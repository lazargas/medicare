            "content": "Iceland: Liver injury and liver inflammation is a rare side effect of infliximab, a biological medicine used to treat multiple inflammatory diseases. In a recent study involving 36 patients with infliximab-induced liver injury, about half of the patients were treated with steroids. The results, published in the Journal of Hepatology suggest that patients who received steroids recovered faster.\nThe researchers observed a good treatment response with prompt resolution of liver test abnormalities in patients with prolonged elevations in ALT after cessation of infliximab therapy who were treated with corticosteroids. Moreover, no patients developed a relapse of liver injury following the discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment. Overall, 75% of patients switched to another biologic agent, and no drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was seen due to the second biologic.\nInfliximab is known to be associated with DILI, particularly drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis (DIAIH). DIAIH is treated commonly with corticosteroids but data on the efficacy of corticosteroids in infliximab-induced DILI is limited. Considering this Helgi Kristinn Björnsson, the University of Iceland, Faculty of Medicine, Reykjavik, Iceland, and colleagues aimed to gather some data on the topic.\nFor this purpose, the patients who were treated with infliximab between 2009-2020 in Iceland and developed elevated liver tests were included. Other specific etiologies of liver enzyme elevations were excluded. Patients treated with corticosteroids were compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids.\nA total of 36 patients with infliximab-induced DILI were identified: median age was 46 years and 28 (78%) were female.\nFollowing were the study's key findings:\nType of liver injury was predominantly hepatocellular (64%).\nMedian peak liver enzymes were: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 393 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 283 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 116 U/L, and bilirubin 13 μmol/L.\nA total of 25 (69%) were positive for anti-nuclear antibody and/or had elevated IgG.\nCorticosteroids were initiated in 17 (47%).\nMedian time from onset of liver injury to peak ALT value was longer in patients treated with corticosteroids, 22 vs. 0 days.\nTime from peak ALT to normalization of liver enzymes was 45 days in the corticosteroid group vs. 77 days in others.\nCorticosteroids were tapered in all patients, with no cases of relapse during the follow-up period of 1,245 days.\nOverall 75% received another biologic, mostly adalimumab, without evidence of liver injury.\n\"In this study of 36 patients with infliximab-induced liver injury, approximately half of patients were treated with steroids and the results suggest that patients receiving steroids recover more quickly,\" the authors concluded.\nReference:\nThe study titled, \"Infliximab-induced liver injury: Clinical phenotypes, autoimmunity and the role of corticosteroid treatment,\" was published in the Journal of Hepatology.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2021.08.024",

The research paper has not been published in an academic journal and yet to be evaluated for the same.\nThe new variant is called 'IHU' in reference to the institute 'IHU Mediterranee Infection', where it was discovered. It has 46 mutations while Omicron or B.1.1.529 is known to have 50 mutations and delta variant or B.1.617.2 genome with 13 mutations.\nThe presence of mutations E484K in IHU variant (which is not seen in both Delta and Omicron) is what makes the researcher believe it more resistant to existing vaccines and infectious than the original virus. However, on a more positive note, the new strain does not give off impression of being spreading quickly. Also, a growing body of research demonstrates that it is doubtful to trigger severe disease.\nResearchers performed reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) on the first identified case sample who had a travel history in Cameroon and vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. They detected three mutations of L452R-negativity, E484K-positivity, and E484Q-negativity that did not correspond to the pattern of the Delta variant (L452R-positive) and Omicron (L452R-negative and negative for S gene detection). This atypical combination makes the new variant different from pre-identified ones.\nThe researchers further performed analysis of viral genomes that revealed the presence of fourteen amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and 9 deletions are located in the spike protein. Another respiratory samples collected from eleven other SARS-CoV-2-positive patients living in the same geographical area were then analyzed until end of November 2021. All these results exhibited the same combination of mutations screened by qPCR in the previous case.\n\"These data are another example of the unpredictability of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and of their introduction in a given geographical area from abroad.' the researchers say in their paper.\nReference: Emergence in Southern France of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of probably Cameroonian origin harbouring both substitutions N501Y and E484K in the spike protein. doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.24.21268174",

            "content": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced, resource-intensive form of life support for patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure, and is typically provided within specialized centres. In a recent review article, researchers have given guidance for clinicians on the role of ECMO in managing critically ill COVID19 patients.\nThe paper was published online in JAMA on December 17, 2021.\nNearly 2 years into the pandemic, the role of ECMO for COVID-19 is slowly coming into focus. As of November 2021, more than 10 500 patients with COVID-19 have been treated with ECMO and reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. The optimal distribution of resources between critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated or not treated with ECMO, however, cannot be precisely adjudicated because of the current, uncontrolled evidence base. Therefore, Dr Daniel Brodie and his team provided 3 approaches to manage ECMO use in critically ill covid patients.\n♦ Firstly, they noted that clinicians should regularly review the criteria used to determine ECMO candidacy to minimize ECMO use in patients unlikely to survive, including those with advanced age or severe multiorgan failure.\n♦ Secondly, they noted that based on the existing supply, regional ECMO capabilities should be optimized by sharing resources and coordinating referrals.\nThey insist on the fair and rational use of ECMO, expediting the transfer of patients to ECMO centres with appropriate capacity, and keeping ECMO teams informed as to utilization rates across each region in real-time.\nThey further advised increasing the ECMO capability by establishing new ECMO centres.\n♦Thirdly, they suggested more robust study designs to evaluate the potential benefits of ECMO for COVID-19. They recommended adaptive trail design with outcomes of interest beyond short- and longer-term mortality including resource consumption, cost, functional outcome and quality of life.\nThe authors wrote, \"There are rapidly increasing treatment options beyond supportive care, including antiviral therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and immunosuppressants. Both current and future treatments are expected to be more successful than in the prevaccination phase of the pandemic and may obviate the need for ECMO in many patients.\"\nThey concluded, \"ECMO remains a therapy of last resort for COVID-19, used for highly selected patients with refractory ARDS who have failed trials of lung-protective ventilation strategies and prone positioning. Regional health care networks and governments should continue to monitor outcomes for patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO and work toward judiciously managing ECMO resources for all critically ill patients.\"\nThey further added, \"The use of ECMO has become increasingly established for patients with COVID-19–related ARDS. Nonetheless, it is likely that the optimal place for ECMO in the algorithm for COVID-19 will continue to evolve, as it joins a widening spectrum of increasingly available treatments in a changing patient population.\"\nFor further information:\nDOI:10.1001/jama.2021.22580",

Also, the researchers note that healthcare providers should carefully consider diabetes patients who have undergone bypass surgery and are at risk of developing postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs). The study results were published in the journal Heliyon on December 01, 2021.\nPoor blood sugar control in diabetes patients undergoing CABG surgery has been related to infectious complications, specifically SSIs that are linked with adverse health surgical outcomes.\nIssa M. Hweidi, Faculty of Nursing, Adult Health Nursing Department, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, and colleagues aimed to examine the effect of two different intraoperative glycemic control protocols, tight and conventional, on thirty-day postoperative SSI rates in diabetes patients undergoing CABG surgery.\nFor this purpose, the researchers employed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with a convenience sample of 144 adult patients who were to undergo CABG surgery. The study was set up in a main referral heart institute in Amman, Jordan.\nThe participants were randomly assigned to either the tight glycemic control group (n = 72), or the conventional glycemic control group (n = 72). Participants in the tight glycemic control group were maintained at an intraoperative blood glucose level of 110–149 mg/dl via continuous intravenous insulin infusion. In the conventional glycemic control group, they were maintained at an intraoperative blood glucose level of 150–180 mg/dl via continuous intravenous insulin infusion. Independent blinded physicians evaluated and compared postoperative SSIs among both groups.\nKey findings include:\nThere was a small portion of the study participants in the tight glycemic control group had SSIs compared to the conventional glycemic control group.\nAs for the tight group, the highest percentage among the infection types was DSWI followed by SHWI and DHWI among the study participants.\nNo SSWI was reported among participants within this group of glycemic control intervention.\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the two glycemic control interventions among study groups.\nIntraoperative tight glycemic control did not reduce thirty-day postoperative SSIs among the participants.\nThe principal findings were that there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of SSI rates and their potential adverse surgical outcomes.\n\"Our results show that the use of tight glycemic control during the intraoperative period can be safely achieved through the judicious implementation of the protocol,\" the researchers wrote. \"It is very important to identify patients who were more likely to develop postoperative SSIs.\"\n\"Therefore, when providing care for at-risk patients, nurses should consider the glycemic stability and glycemic control approach to minimize the occurrence of adverse surgical outcomes post-CABG surgery, more specifically SSIs,\" they concluded.\nReference:\nThe study titled, \"The effect of intraoperative glycemic control on surgical site infections among diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery,\" was published in the journal Heliyon.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08529",

Further does not cut hospital stay and is associated with high side effect risk.\nColchicine, a cheap anti-inflammatory drug normally used to treat gout, doesn't lessen COVID-19 severity or stave off the risk of death from the infection in hospital patients, finds a pooled analysis of the available evidence, published in the open access journal RMD Open.\nWhat's more, it's associated with a high risk of side effects, particularly diarrhoea, the analysis shows.\nEarly observational studies suggested that colchicine might be a useful addition to the treatments available for COVID-19 infection, and it has already found its way into clinical practice in some places.\nIn a bid to clarify its safety and effectiveness, the researchers trawled research databases looking for relevant comparative clinical trial data on the use of the drug for the treatment of COVID-19 infection, published up to July 2021.\nThe researchers wanted to find out if colchicine reduced the risk of death, the need for ventilatory support, intensive care admission and length of hospital stay; and if its use was associated with any particular side effects.\nThey applied the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the evidence for each of these outcomes.\nObservational studies, laboratory studies, animal studies, and studies with fewer than 10 participants were all excluded.\nOut of 69 full texts assessed, 6 randomised controlled trials involving 16,148 patients with varying degrees of severity of COVID-19 were included in the pooled data analysis.\nThis showed that there was no significant reduction in the risk of death (6 studies), the need for ventilatory support (5 studies), admission to intensive care (3 studies), length of hospital stay (4 studies) or serious side effects (3 studies) between those patients treated with colchicine and those given usual supportive care only.\nPatients taking colchicine also had 58% higher rates of side effects and almost double the risk of diarrhoea than those given supportive care.\nThe GRADE quality of the evidence was moderate for most of the outcomes studied.\nThe researchers caution: \"Our findings on colchicine should be interpreted cautiously due to the inclusion of open labelled randomised clinical trials. The analysis of efficacy and safety outcomes are based on a small number of [randomised controlled trials] in control interventions.\"\nBut they conclude: \"Colchicine does not reduce the risk of mortality, need for ventilatory support, intensive care unit admission or length of hospital stay among patients with COVID-19. There is no additional benefit of adding colchicine to supportive care in the management of patients with COVID-19.\"",

By 2030, the number of people in the U.S. with AFib is expected to climb to an estimated 12.1 million. Chronic health conditions including type 1 or type 2 diabetes, asthma and hyperthyroidism are known to increase the risk of AFib.\n\"Since diabetes is one of the major risk factors for AFib, our team investigated whether patients with and without diabetes differ in terms of atrial fibrillation symptoms and complications,\" said study author Tobias Reichlin, M.D., professor of cardiology at Bern University Hospital at the University of Bern in Bern, Switzerland. \"This research can provide insights on improving the management of atrial fibrillation and prevention of its complications.\"\nResearchers studied 2,411 patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who were enrolled at 14 health care centers in Switzerland from 2014 to 2017 as part of the Swiss-AF (Swiss Atrial Fibrillation) Study. The average age of the study's participants was approximately 74 years, and about 27% were women.\nUpon enrollment in the study, participants were required to receive a clinical examination, blood sampling, cognitive assessment, quality of life assessment and 5-minute resting ECG (electrocardiogram). About 17% of the study participants were diagnosed with diabetes, according to their medical records and if they were taking any diabetes medications; they were not classified by the U.S. standards of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Among the study participants diagnosed with diabetes, they were further categorized as having either insulin-dependent diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes, both of which included people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes as defined in the U.S.\nTo determine how diabetes may affect AFib patients, researchers compared AFib symptoms, quality of life outcomes, cardiac comorbidities and neurological comorbidities among participants with and without diabetes. Compared to people with AFib who did not have diabetes:\nPeople with diabetes were about 25% less likely than those without diabetes to recognize common symptoms of atrial fibrillation such as a rapid heartbeat;\nPeople with diabetes were three times more likely than those without diabetes to have high blood pressure; 55% more likely to have had heart attacks; and about twice as likely to have heart failure; and\nPeople with diabetes had a 39% increased stroke risk and were 75% more likely to have cognitive impairment.\n\"It is remarkable to find that patients with diabetes had a reduced recognition of atrial fibrillation symptoms,\" Reichlin said. \"The reduced perception of atrial fibrillation symptoms may result in a delayed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and, consequently, more complications such as stroke. Our findings raise the question of whether patients with diabetes should be routinely screened for atrial fibrillation.\"\nWhen researchers examined specific areas related to quality of life, they also found that having diabetes and AFib negatively impacted mobility, self-care and normal activities more so than for the people without diabetes.\n\"These important new findings from the large Swiss AF study show compared to AFib patients without diabetes, those with diabetes were less likely to experience any symptom related to atrial fibrillation,\" said Prakash Deedwania, M.D., a member of the scientific advisory board for Know Diabetes By Heart (KDBH), a joint initiative of the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, the immediate past chair of the American Heart Association Diabetes Committee and a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. \"These results were seen even though people with diabetes and AFib had more coexisting health conditions such as high blood pressure, as well as a history of heart attack and heart failure. Keeping these new observations in mind, along with the serious consequences of failing to recognize AFib in time, it seems prudent to consider screening older patients with diabetes for AFib so that treatment may be initiated when appropriate.\"\nThe researchers note several potential limitations to this research. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on the medical history of the study's participants rather than laboratory criteria; therefore, the prevalence of diabetes may have been underreported. Also, data was not available on the duration of diabetes or the degree of glycemic control. Additionally, the study included only residents of Switzerland, therefore, the generalizability of the findings to other populations or people living in other countries requires further investigation. Future studies among larger, more diverse populations of people are needed to confirm these findings.",

            "content": "USA: A recent study reported that adults with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at an increased risk of developing sleep disorders -- which is associated with higher levels of the inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP). This may substantially increase the risk of developing adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. The findings of the study were presented during a late-breaking abstract session at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis virtual symposium.\nAtopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease common in both adults and children. It is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life and numerous systemic comorbidities. However, there is no clarity on the association between AD, sleep disturbance, and systemic inflammation. To fill this knowledge gap, Varsha Parthasarathy, Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology, Baltimore MD, and colleagues aimed to examine the comorbidity burden of sleep disorders in AD patients and associate findings with inflammatory C-reactive protein and cardiovascular comorbidities in a large, multicenter cohort.\n\"The implications of these findings are vast,\" said presenting author Dr. Parthasarathy during the presentation. \"Poor sleep quality is known to be associated with increased inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-17, and CRP, so it is interesting to see this reflected in AD patients with versus without sleep disturbance. Additionally, we know that CRP is a driver of inflammation and is strongly associated with cardiovascular complications such as heart attack and stroke. Therefore, CRP may be a useful prognostic marker in AD patients with sleep disturbances.\"\nFor carrying out the study, the researchers used TriNetX, a healthcare network of approximately 73 million medical records. AD patients aged 18 years or older were identified as having ≥2 instances of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code L28 for AD, to identify a population with true atopic dermatitis.\nThese patients were age, race, and sex-matched to controls without AD presenting for general checkups. A total of 120,480 adult AD patients were identified.\nTo examine the possible impact of sleep disorders on inflammatory biomarkers, the researchers also examined C-reactive protein levels in these patients.\nKey findings include:\nBefore matching, the AD group was younger (36.4 ± 23.1 years vs. 46.8 ± 19.8 years) and had higher percentages of female sex (61% vs. 58%) and Black race (26% vs. 17%) than the controls.\nAfter matching, there were no age, gender, or racial differences between the groups.\nRelative to controls, AD patients had an increased risk of developing general sleep disorders [relative risk (RR) 1.10], obstructive sleep apnea [RR 1.13], insomnia [RR 1.10], hypersomnia [RR 1.24], sleep-related movement disorders [RR 1.36], restless legs syndrome [RR 1.25], sleep deprivation [RR 1.36], and unspecified sleep disorders [RR 1.22].\nAD patients had higher mean CRP than controls (mean ± SD 21.2 ± 43.9 mg/L vs. 7.6 ± 41.1 mg/L) and AD patients with sleep disorders had higher CRP than AD patients without sleep disorders (23.3 ± 44.3 mg/L vs. 20.6 ± 43.6 mg/L).\nAD patients with sleep disorders were more likely to develop obesity [RR 2.65], hyperlipidemia [RR 2.18], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR 2.45], metabolic syndrome [RR 4.16], atherosclerosis [RR 2.42], peripheral vascular disease [RR 2.47], stroke [RR 2.37], venous thromboembolism [RR 2.93], and mortality [hazard ratio 1.24] than matched AD patients without sleep disorders.\n\"Adults with AD have an increased risk of developing sleep disorders, which is associated with elevation of the inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein,\" wrote the authors.\n\"This elevation in CRP may contribute to the systemic inflammatory impact of AD and substantially increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Physicians are recommended to screen for these sleep-related comorbidities in all AD patients.\" they concluded.\nReference:\nAbstract: Elevated C-reactive protein levels in atopic dermatitis patients with sleep disturbance is associated with the development of cardiovascular comorbidities and increased mortality: a multi-center cohort study",

            "content": "Focused clinical ultrasonography (FCU) has been shown to be a reliable and accurate test compared with the imaging reference standard. However, a recent study suggests that integration of multiorgan focused clinical ultrasonography with the initial evaluation does not reduce hospital length of stay by more than 24 hours. The study findings were published in the JAMA Network Open on December 21, 2021.\nThere are accumulating data about the utility of diagnostic multiorgan focused clinical ultrasonography in the assessment of patients admitted with cardiopulmonary symptoms. However, there is limited information on how FCU affects the clinical decision-making process in the internal medicine setting. Moreover, the information available on the impact of FCU on the hospital length of stay (LOS) is unclear. Therefore, Dr Ximena Cid-Serra and her team conducted a study to determine whether adding multiorgan FCU to the initial clinical evaluation of patients admitted with cardiopulmonary symptoms reduces hospital length of stay, hospital readmissions, and in-hospital costs.\nIt was a prospective, parallel-group, superiority, randomized study, in which the researchers included 248 patients who were admitted to the internal medicine ward with a cardiopulmonary diagnosis. They compared the heart, lung, and 2-point vein compression FCU in addition (n=124) to standard clinical evaluation (n=124). The major outcome was the difference in the mean length of hospital stay, defined as the number of hours from admission to the internal medicine ward to hospital discharge. They determined a difference of 24 hours as clinically important. The researchers further assessed the hospital readmissions at 30 days and hospital care costs.\nKey findings of the study:\nUpon analysis, the researchers noted that the most common initial diagnoses were acute decompensated heart failure reported in 113 patients, pneumonia for 45 patients, and exacerbated chronic pulmonary disease for 32 patients.\nThey observed that the length of hospital stay was 113.4 hours in the FCU group and 125.3 hours in the control group.\nThey further observed no difference in30-day readmission rate between groups (FCU vs control, 20 of 124 patients [16.1%] vs 15 of 124 patients [12.0%]), nor were total in-hospital costs (FCU vs control, A$7831.1 vs A$7895.7).\nThe authors concluded, \"Adding multiorgan FCU to the initial clinical assessment compared with standard care did not reduce the hospital LOS among patients admitted with cardiopulmonary diagnoses to this internal medicine unit. Although there was a difference of 11.9 hours in the mean hospital LOS between groups, the result was not significant according to the prespecified clinically meaningful difference.\"\nFor further information:\nDOI:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.38228",

            "content": "Austria: A recent study stated that COVID-19 vaccination does not significantly change blood sugar (glycemic) control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, a worsening of glycemia was observed in T1D patients in conjunction with vaccine side effects.\nResults, published in the journal Diabetes Care, are based on a substudy of the Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccination in People with Diabetes Mellitus (COVAC-DM) -- multicenter, prospective study.\nDiabetes patients are generally considered a high-risk population in the scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and hence are prioritized in the COVID-19 vaccine policy. Felix Aberer, Interdisciplinary Metabolic Medicine Trials Unit, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria, and colleagues aimed to investigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the time spent in different glycemic ranges -- assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with T1D and T2D.\nThe study included 74 diabetic patients who had sufficient CGM data available during their first COVID-19 vaccination. Out of these patients, 58 participants had T1D (mean age, 39.5±14.1 years; mean glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 57±12 mol/mol), and 16 had T2D (mean age, 60.6±6.2 years; mean HbA1c, 63±11 mmol/mol).\nMost of the patients had received an mRNA-based vaccine (87% BioNTech Pfizer and 6% Moderna vs 7% AstraZeneca). Data from CGM were assessed from 2 days prior until 3 days after the first vaccination dose for time spent in different glycemic ranges.\nThe researchers also created a score that assessed the time spent in glycemic ranges in relation to side effects such as body ache, fatigue, headache, and any injection site reaction, as well as an elevated body temperature of >37°C.\nFollowing were the study's key findings:\n· No significant differences were found in patients with T1D or those with T2D regarding the time in range (TIR) (70-180 mg/dL) from 2 days before receiving the vaccine until 3 days afterward.\n· The time below range (TBR) (˂70 mg/dL; T1D; T2D) and the time above range (TAR) (˃180 mg/dL; T1D; T2D) did not change around the time of the COVID-19 vaccination.\n· Patients with T1D had significantly less TIR on days they experienced side effects from the vaccine, compared with days they did not experience side effects.\n· Side effects had no significant influence on TBR in patients with T1D.\n· For patients with T2D, the side effect score had no effect on TIR, TAR, or TBR.\n· Glycemic variability, measured as a coefficient of variation, was not significantly different regarding side effect score for either T1D or T2D.\n\"Our findings showed that the COVID-19 vaccination did not change glycemic control in diabetic people,\" wrote the authors. \"A deterioration of glycemia was however observed in people with type 1 diabetes on days on which side effects were present.\"\nThere is a need for further investigation of this observation in larger studies but it can be considered when health care professionals inform their patients about potential glycemic aberrations in response to COVID-19 immunization, they concluded.\nReference:\nFelix Aberer, Othmar Moser, Faisal Aziz, Caren Sourij, Haris Ziko, Jacqueline Lenz, Farah Abbas, Anna M.

            "content": "USA: Data from the REDUCE-IT RENAL trial showed that among statin-treated patients with increased triglycerides and well-controlled LDL-cholesterol, icosapent ethyl reduces cardiovascular events. These benefits also extend to patients with impaired renal function.\nPatients with elevated triglycerides have a significant residual risk for coronary events, despite having well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on statin therapy. The study, published in the journal Circulation found that treatment with icosapent ethyl may significantly reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. The findings are applicable to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients across the spectrum of baseline kidney function.\nCKD is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes. Medication sued commonly for CVD treatment is less effective among those with reduced kidney function. In the analysis, Deepak L. Bhatt, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, and colleagues to explore the effects of icosapent ethyl versus placebo across the range of kidney function among patients enrolled in the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial) -- a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nIn the REDUCE-IT trial, statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides (135–499 mg/dL) who had CVD or diabetes and 1 additional risk factor were randomly assigned to treatment with icosapent ethyl (4 g daily) or placebo. For the analysis, patients from the trial were categorized by prespecified estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories to analyze the effect of icosapent ethyl on the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint.\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.\nMedian baseline eGFR was 75 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2 (range, 17–123 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2) among the 8179 REDUCE-IT patients.\nBased on the analysis, the researchers found the following:\nThere were no meaningful changes in median eGFR for icosapent ethyl versus placebo across study visits.\nTreatment with icosapent ethyl led to a consistent reduction in both the primary and key secondary composite endpoints across baseline eGFR categories.\nPatients with eGFR <60 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2 treated with icosapent ethyl had the largest absolute and similar relative risk reduction for the primary composite endpoint (icosapent ethyl versus placebo, 21.8% versus 28.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71) and key secondary composite endpoint (16.8% versus 22.5%; HR 0.71).\nThe numeric reduction in cardiovascular death was greatest in the eGFR <60 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2 group (icosapent ethyl: 7.6%; placebo: 10.6%; HR, 0.70).\nAlthough patients with eGFR <60 mL·min–1·1.73 m–2 treated with icosapent ethyl had the highest numeric rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter (icosapent ethyl: 4.2%; placebo 3.0%; HR 1.42) and serious bleeding (icosapent ethyl: 5.4%; placebo 3.6%; HR, 1.40), HRs for atrial fibrillation/flutter and serious bleeding were similar across eGFR categories.\nThe authors concluded, \"in REDUCE-IT, icosapent ethyl reduced fatal and nonfatal ischemic events across the broad range of baseline eGFR categories.\"\nReference:\nThe study titled, \"Benefits of Icosapent Ethyl Across the Range of Kidney Function in Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease or Diabetes: REDUCE-IT RENAL,\" was published in the journal Circulation.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.055560",

An important priority of transgender health research is to better understand the metabolic changes induced by gender-affirming hormone therapy, and a specific area of interest is the occurrence of type 2 diabetes.\n\"Our study findings provide some reassurance that gender-affirming therapy does not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, but our analysis was not designed to evaluate more subtle subclinical changes,\" said Noreen Islam, M.D., M.P.H., of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Ga. \"For this reason, health care providers should continue monitoring the metabolic status of individuals receiving gender-affirming therapy.\"\nThe researchers studied data from an electronic health record-based cohort study of people 18 years and older enrolled in three integrated health care systems over a 9-year period. The cohort included 2,869 transgender women matched to 28,300 cisgender women and 28,258 cisgender men; and 2,133 transgender men matched to 20,997 cisgender women and 20,964 cisgender men.\nType 2 diabetes was more common in transgender women compared to cisgender women. Cisgender is defined as a person whose gender identity is the same as their sex assigned at birth. The researchers found no significant differences in type 2 diabetes prevalence or incidence across the remaining comparison groups, both overall and in transgender people undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\"Although more research is needed, there is little evidence that type 2 diabetes occurrence in either transgender women or transgender men is attributable to gender-affirming hormone therapy, at least in the short term,\" Islam said.\nThe manuscript, \"Is There a Link Between Hormone Use and Diabetes Incidence in Transgender People? Data from the STRONG Cohort,\" was published online, ahead of print.",

Patients with mild disease should monitor temperature and oxygen level, and should seek medical attention if experience difficult in breathing or high fever/cough for more than 5 days, the guideline notes.\nModerate COVID-19 Infection\nAccording to the guideline, a patient is classified as a moderate case of COVID-19 if their respiratory rate is more than 24/min and SpO2 level 90%- 93% on room air. Patient may require hospital treatment at this stage. Treatment for moderate case as has been approved by ICMR:\nOxygen Support: The targeted level of SpO2 should be 92-96%, 88-92% in case of COPD patients. The guideline recommends non-breathing facemask for oxygenation.\nFor all the patients requiring oxygen supplemental oxygen therapy awake proning method should be encourage thereby changing position every 2 hours.\nAnti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory therapy.\nThe guideline recommends injecting of Methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg in 2 divided doses for 5-10 days. In case of stable or improving conditions, this may be switched to oral route.\nAnticoagulation- Prophylactic un-fractioned heparin or Low molecular Weight heparin at conventional dose with no contraindication or high risk of bleeding.\nThings to be monitored with moderate COVID-19 pateints Work of breathing, hemodynamic instability, change in oxygen requirement, X rays and HRCT chest, only when the patient's condition worsens. Additionally, CRP and D-dimer should also be monitored every 48 to 72 hours.\nPatient with Severe COVID-19 Infection\nPatients with respiratory rate greater than 30/min with SpO2 less than 90% on room air are severe infection as per the guideline. At this stage, patients need to be in Intensive Care Unit. Treatment recommended by the guideline for severe infection:\nRespiratory Support-\nUse of Non Invasive Ventilation in patients with work breathing low and High flow nasal cannula in case of increasing oxygen requirement are recommended. Intubation is suggested if NIV is not tolerated with high work of breathing. Conventional protocol for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome should be maintained while practicing ventilator.\nAnti-inflammatory- Methylprednisolone 1 to 2mg/kg IV in 2 divided doses for 5-10 days.\nAnticoagulation and thing to be monitored is same as Moderate infection treatment as listed above.\nMaintaining euvolemia and management of sepsis shock has been listed as the supportive measures by the guideline.\nWho are at high risk for Severe Disease or Mortality?\nPatient aged above 60 years with comorbidities such as CVD, hypertension and CAD, diabetes, chronic lung/kidney/liver disease and cerebrovascular disease are at high risk for severe infection as per the guideline.\nUSE of Remdesivir and Tocilizumbab\nThe guideline recommend the use of Remdesivir only in patients with moderate to severe with no renal dysfunction and who are within 10 days of onset of symptoms. 200 mg IV on day 1 followed by 100 mg for next 4 days. It is restricted for patients who are not on oxygen support or home setting.\nUse of Tocilizumab (Off label) may be considered if severe disease is present, raising of inflammatory markers with no improvement despite use of steroids when no active bacterial/fungal infection is found. 4-6mg/kg in 100ml Normal Saline over one hour is the dose, the guideline writes.\nIf you want to read the full guidelines click on the following link\nhttps://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/techdoc/COVID_Management_Algorithm_23092021.pdf",

            "content": "Adult-onset asthma (AOA) was shown to be connected with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its accompanying pro-inflammatory endocrine and cytokine state in a new study undertaken by Geertje M. de Boer and colleagues.\nThe findings of this study were published in the Journal of Respiratory Medicine on 10th September, 2021.\nAOA is frequently more severe than childhood asthma (CoA). Given the growing evidence that AoA is linked to obesity, researchers in this study looked at the connection of other relevant metabolic comorbid disorders with AoA vs CoA.\nThe metabolic syndrome and lipid-derived inflammatory markers were compared in patients with AoA, CoA, and age- and sex-matched control people without asthma in this cross-sectional investigation. Asthmatic patients visiting the outpatient clinics of two teaching hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, took part in the study. Lung function tests, blood testing, and physical activity tracking were performed on all individuals. Asthma age of onset after the age of 18 years was classified as AoA. The international joint interim statement criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome.\nThe key findings of this study are as follow:\n1. There were 81 competitors in all (27 AoA, 25 CoA, 29 controls). AoA was linked to the metabolic syndrome (Odds Ratio = 3.64 95% CI (1.16–11.42) p = 0.03, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.26), even after controlling for age, gender, BMI, and smoking behaviours.\n2. When compared to controls, AoA patients exhibited higher median serum IL-6 and leptin-adiponectin (LA) ratios (IL-6 (pg/mL): 3.10 [1.11–4.30] vs. 1.13 [0.72–1.58], p = 0.002 ; LA ratio (pg/mL): 6.21 [2.45–14.11] vs. 2.24 [0.67–4.71], p = 0.0390).\n3. This was not seen in the CoA or the controls.\nIn conclusion, this study's findings suggest that MetS, regardless of BMI, may be linked to AoA. Researchers believe that inflammatory markers generated from adipose tissue, which are produced in adipose tissue, contribute to the immunopathology of AoA. MetS, not just obesity, should be considered a significant therapeutic feature in AoA.\nReference:\nde Boer, G. M., Tramper-Stranders, G. A., Houweling, L., van Zelst, C. M., Pouw, N., Verhoeven, G.

The relative effectiveness of Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) and vs Povidone-iodine (PVI)-based skin antiseptics in clean surgery is unknown.\nAccording to one research, alcohol formulations of 4%–5% CHG appear to be safe and twice as efficient as PVI (alcoholic or aqueous solutions) in avoiding infection following clean surgery in adults.\nThis study was conducted by Ryckie G. Wade & team and the findings of this work are published in Annals of Surgery of December 2021 volume.\nPreoperative skin antisepsis in clean surgery is fraught with uncertainties. Network meta-analysis gives more exact estimates than traditional pairwise meta-analysis and may rank therapies in terms of efficacy, which can help influence therapeutic decisions.\nResearchers looked for randomized or nonrandomized trials that compared the effect of different CHG and PVI preparations on the dichotomous outcome of surgical site infection. They included research on people who had clean surgery. They also rejected research using indwelling vascular catheters, blood samples, combination antiseptics, or sequential antiseptic treatments. To estimate the relative efficacy of interventions using relative risks, a network meta-analysis was performed.\nThe results of this study stated as follows:\n1. This analysis includes 17 trials that compared 5 antiseptics in 14,593 people.\n2. Overall, the risk of surgical site infection was 3%. The most effective antiseptic was alcoholic CHG 4 percent–5%, which reduced the risk of surgical site infection by half when compared to aqueous PVI [RR 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.24, 1.02)] and also to alcoholic PVI, though the uncertainty was higher [RR 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.21, 1.27)].\n3. Adverse events associated with antiseptic application were only observed in patients who had been exposed to PVI.\nIn conclusion, The findings of this study agree with the literature on contaminated and clean-contaminated surgery, and they support international guidelines that promote the use of alcoholic CHG for preoperative skin antisepsis.\nReference:\nWade, R.

Franco Locatelli and the team aimed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in adult and pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and a non–β0/β0 genotype.\nFor this purpose, 23 patients underwent myeloablation with busulfan (with doses adjusted on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis) and received beti-cel intravenously. They were followed for a median of 29.5 months.\nThe primary endpoint was transfusion independence defined as weighted average hemoglobin level of ≥9 g per deciliter without red-cell transfusions for ≥12 months.\nThe study revealed the following findings:\nTransfusion independence occurred in 20 of 22 patients who could be evaluated (91%), including 6 of 7 patients (86%) who were younger than 12 years of age.\nThe average hemoglobin level during transfusion independence was 11.7 g per deciliter.\nTwelve months after beti-cel infusion, the median level of gene therapy–derived adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbAT87Q) was 8.7 g per deciliter in patients who had transfusion independence.\nThe safety profile of beti-cel was consistent with that of busulfan-based myeloablation.\nFour patients had at least one adverse event that was considered by the investigators to be related or possibly related to beti-cel; all events were nonserious except for thrombocytopenia (in 1 patient).\nNo cases of cancer were observed.\nTo conclude, treatment with beti-cel resulted in a sustained HbAT87Q level and a total hemoglobin level that was high enough to enable transfusion independence in most patients with a non–β0/β0 genotype, including those younger than 12 years of age.\nReference:\nThe study titled, \"Betibeglogene Autotemcel Gene Therapy for Non–β0/β0 Genotype β-Thalassemia,\" was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nDOI: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2113206",

Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified β-globin gene, which produces antisickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q.\nIn this ongoing phase 1–2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial 7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease, and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up.\nThe results of the study are:\nAs of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbAT87Q contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (±SD) of 85±8% of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment. Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed during up to 37.6 months of follow-up.\nThus, the researchers concluded that one-time treatment with LentiGlobin resulted in sustained production of HbAT87Q in most red cells, leading to reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events.\nReference:\nBiologic and Clinical Efficacy of LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease by Julie Kanter, et al. published in the new England journal of medicine.\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2117175",

            "content": "Cluster headaches have significant limitations, including a paucity of large non-clinic-based research. There is also a scarcity of data on certain features of cluster headache, such as pediatric occurrence.\nCluster headaches are common in the pediatric population, according to a recent study conducted by Larry I. Schor and colleagues, although they are often not identified until adulthood.\nThe goal of this study was to confirm diagnoses and explore epidemiological data from a worldwide, non-clinic-based, large (n = 1604) survey of cluster headache participants.\nThe findings of this study were published in the Headache - Journal of Head and face pain on November 28th, 2021.\nThe International Cluster Headache Questionnaire was an internet-based survey that asked about cluster headache demographics, International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria, and medicines.\nThe key findings of this work are:\n1. A total of 3251 people took part in the study, with 1604 of them meeting the ICHD criteria for cluster headache. Researchers interviewed a random sample of 5% of participants for validation and verified the diagnosis of cluster headache in 97.5%.\n2. Only 27.5% of individuals had pediatric onset, and only 15.2% of those with pediatric onset were diagnosed before the age of 18.\n3. Men were more prevalent than women to suffer episodic cluster headache between the ages of 10 and 50, while the sex ratio was almost similar at other ages.\n4. The vast majority of responders reported at least one autonomic characteristic and restlessness, but many also reported stereotypical migrainous symptoms such as photophobia or phonophobia, pain increased by physical exercise, or nausea and vomiting.\n5. Interestingly, as compared to episodic cluster headache, the first-line drugs for acute treatment (oxygen) and preventative treatment (calcium channel blockers) were evaluated as much less effective in chronic cluster headache.\nIn conclusion, the start of cluster headache is the inverse of that of migraine; with migraine, women are more likely to suffer migraine between the ages of 10 and 50, but otherwise the sex ratio is almost similar. Prototypical migrainous characteristics are ineffective in distinguishing cluster headache from migraine. Data from a major worldwide trial further reveal that persistent cluster headache is less sensitive not just to novel therapies (such as noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation and galcanezumab), but also to standard first-line medications.\nReference:\nSchor LI, Pearson SM, Shapiro RE, Zhang W, Miao H, Burish MJ.

            "content": "USA: As the number of Omicron cases continues to increase in India and worldwide, two recently approved antiviral pills could be a game-changer for the most vulnerable. However, the experts have cautioned that the new medications may not be safe for everyone and might require careful monitoring by doctors and pharmacists.\nThe U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has recently given approval for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to two drugs to be used in certain patients. The drugs are described are -- Molnupiravir, developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for severe disease, and Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer Inc for treating mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and children 12 years and older, who are likely to be at greater risk for severe infection.\nBoth treatments are available by prescription only and should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 and within five days of symptom onset.\nAbout Paxlovid\nPfizer's Paxlovid is authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms or about 88 pounds) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.\nPaxlovid's treatment is a combination of two pills taken over five days-- the Paxlovid cocktail consists of two tablets of the antiviral nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir. However, one of the two drugs in the antiviral cocktail could result in severe or life-threatening interactions with widely used medications, including blood thinners, statins, and some antidepressants. And, Paxlovid is not recommended for people with severe kidney or liver disease.\nNirmatrelvir (Paxlovid, Pfizer) is a viral protease inhibitor with expected in vitro activity against all clinically significant SARS-CoV-2 variants to date. In an unpublished manufacturer-supported study, nirmatrelvir boosted with the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir reduced rates of hospitalization or all-cause death by almost 90% among unvaccinated high-risk adults outpatients with confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19.\nA study involving vaccinated standard-risk adults is ongoing. The drug has also been authorized for unvaccinated children and teens 12 and older. The dosing regimen consists of two 150-mg nirmatrelvir tablets and one 100-mg ritonavir tablet taken together twice daily for 5 days. Renal impairment requires dose reduction; patients with severe liver or kidney disease should not receive treatment. Coadministration with drugs metabolized by CYP3A or those inducing the enzyme may be dangerous. No specific adverse effects have been associated with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir to date.\nAbout Molnupiravir\nMerck's molnupiravir is authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.\nMolnupiravir is not authorized for use in patients younger than 18 years of age because molnupiravir may affect bone and cartilage growth. It is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 because the benefit of treatment has not been observed in people when treatment started after hospitalization due to COVID-19.\nMolnupiravir (Lagevrio, Merck) is a nucleoside analog that induces fatal mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; it too has demonstrated in vitro activity against all clinically significant viral variants.\nIn a manufacturer-supported study of high-risk unvaccinated adult outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the drug reduced rates of hospitalization or all-cause mortality by about 30%. Because of concerns about possible mutagenicity, molnupiravir is not recommended during pregnancy; and because of possible toxicity to the bone, cartilage, or both, the drug has not been authorized for children or teens younger than 18. The dose is four 200-mg capsules twice daily for 5 days. Side effects have been limited to mild decreases in hemoglobin. No renal or hepatic adjustments are necessary, and no drug-drug interactions have been identified. An FDA advisory committee also articulated concerns about the drug's potential ability to generate viral mutants of concern.\nReference:\n1) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Additional Oral Antiviral for Treatment of COVID-19 in Certain Adults\n2) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes First Oral Antiviral for Treatment of COVID-19",

            "content": "New Delhi : A team of researchers have highlighted that Cilnidipine has similar anti-hypertensive effects compared with other first-line antihypertensive drugs commonly used in practice. The findings of the meta-analysis have been put forth in the Cureus Journal.\nObserving the results, they further elaborated that \"We recommend Cilnidipine as a novel first-line CCB for the management of hypertension either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy.\"\nHypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, and the prevalence of hypertension continues to rise across the globe. National and international guidelines recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and beta-blockers for the management of hypertension. CCBs are among the most used antihypertensive medications.\nCilnidipine is a newer dihydropyridine CCB shown to have a prolonged antihypertensive property, being a L/N-type calcium channel blocker, it lowers the BP in part by sympathetic nerve inhibition at the peripheral sympathetic nerve endings in vivo, and has reported a lower incidence of pedal edema compared to amlodipine.\nWith such background , the researchers under Chakraborty et al, aimed to carry out a meta-analysis of comparative randomized and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of Cilnidipine monotherapy or combination therapy on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate (PR) over 48 weeks of therapy.\nStudy design consisted of searching PubMed (MEDLINE) and Google scholar databases to identify studies designed to evaluate the effects of Cilnidipine in the treatment of hypertensive patients. The study criteria for inclusion into the meta-analysis were all prospective, randomized, and non-randomized clinical studies published till March 2021, studies published in a peer-reviewed journal, the inclusion of patients with hypertension, assessment of blood pressure and heart rate, and a follow-up of four weeks or longer. The primary outcomes assessed were changes in SBP, DBP, and PR from baseline at the end of therapy compared between the Cilnidipine and other CCB's.\nThe key facts that were revealed have been summarized.\nThe initial search identified 82 potential articles; of these, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Studies with <4 weeks treatment period and those not having a CCB were excluded.\nCilnidipine caused a significant reduction (p<0.05) in SBP, DBP, and PR at end of therapy, whereas the reduction in SBP, DBP, and PR with Cilnidipine were similar to other CCB's (p>0.05).\nThe results of this meta-analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in the efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive patients with Cilnidipine and the other therapies.\nObserving the results, the team concluded that \"We recommend Cilnidipine as a novel first-line CCB for the management of hypertension either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy. Cilnidipine is highly lipophilic and shows low BP variability among CCBs. The organ protection, especially the reno-protective effect of Cilnidipine deserves special attention. In earlier trials, Cilnidipine was found to be safe and effective in reducing microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. We warrant further studies to reinforce the cardio-protection and renoprotection efficacy of Cilnidipine, particularly in hypertensive diabetic patients.\"\nFor full article follow the link: DOI: 10.7759/cureus.19822\nSource: Cureus",

            "content": "Netherlands: According to a new study, serum selenium was independently linked to numerous metabolic syndrome symptoms. Furthermore, elevated selenium levels were linked to lower mortality and new-onset heart failure (HF) among nonsmokers.\nThis study was conducted by Ali A. Al-Mubarak and the team and the findings were published in the European Journal of Heart Failure on 20th December 2021.\nThe goal of this study was to determine the connection between blood selenium levels and the risk of death and new-onset heart failure in the general adult population. Selenium was evaluated in a Dutch cohort for this study, and a retrospective analysis of prospectively assessed data was undertaken. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the incidence of new-onset heart failure, both independently and as a composite endpoint.\nThe key findings of this study are as follow:\n1. Serum selenium concentrations were tested in 5973 participants, and the mean selenium concentration was 84.6 (19.5) g/L.\n2. The average age was 53.6 (12.1) years, and 3103 (52%) of the participants were female. The average length of follow-up was 8.4 years.\n3. Selenium levels were favorably related with female sex, higher total cholesterol, and glucose concentrations, and adversely associated with anemia, iron insufficiency, current smoking, rising C-reactive protein levels, and a higher BMI.\n4. Univariate analysis on all individuals revealed no relationship between continuous selenium concentrations per 10 g/L rise and the composite outcome. However, there was a substantial relationship with smoking status.\n5. Continuous selenium concentrations were independently related with lower risk of death, lower risk of new-onset HF, and lower risk of the composite endpoint in nonsmokers (N=4288).\n6. There were no connections detected among participants who smoked.\nIn conclusion, the findings show that serum selenium has an independent relationship with numerous metabolic syndrome markers. In nonsmokers, high selenium concentrations were found to be independently associated with lower mortality and new-onset heart failure. To assess the potential benefit of supplementing selenium, well-powered interventional trials are required, particularly in nonsmokers.\nReference:\nAl-Mubarak, A.A., Beverborg, N.G., Suthahar, N., Gansevoort, R.T., Bakker, S.J., Touw, D.J., de Boer, R.A., van der Meer, P. and Bomer, N.

Insomnia in hospitalized adults is a common condition and a source of patient dissatisfaction.\nA recent study suggests that a predictive algorithm, paired with targeted and informative clinical decision support (CDS), can assist physicians to identify stable hospitalized patients. They found no significant harm in reducing overnight vital sign checks in such patients. However, the predictive algorithm does not reduce the incidence of delirium. The study findings were published in the JAMA Internal Medicine on December 28, 2021.\nIatrogenic interruptions are a major cause of sleep deprivation in hospitalized patients. Whether CDS, including analytics to target sleep promotion interventions to appropriate patients, would be safe and effective is unclear. Therefore, Dr Nader Najafi ad his team conducted a study to determine whether a clinical decision support tool, powered by real-time patient data and a trained prediction algorithm, can help physicians identify clinically stable patients and safely discontinue their overnight vital signs checks.\nThey conducted a randomized clinical trial and noted 3,025 total encounters screened by the CDS tool. The researchers then randomized 966 patient encounters to the intervention arm and 964 to the usual care arm. They also included physicians serving the patients on the general medical service.\nThe CDS tool notified physicians to patients who were at low risk for abnormal nighttime vital signs and therefore candidates for a skipped nighttime vital sign check. CTS Tool was based on a logistic regression model that used real-time patient data as input.\nThe major outcome assessed was the incidence of delirium, determined by bedside nurse assessment of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale scores, a standardized delirium screening tool (delirium diagnosed with score ≥2). They also assessed the mean nighttime vital sign checks. Potential harms were determined as intensive care unit transfers and code blue alarms.\nKey findings of the study:\nUpon analysis, the researchers found that the sleep promotion intervention was not associated with a reduction in delirium compared with usual care in the general medicine service (11% vs 13%).\nHowever, they noted a 31% reduction in vital sign checks per night in the intervention arm with no potential harms, suggesting that for some patients, overnight vital sign checks can be reduced with no adverse effects.\n\"It is not surprising that the intervention was not able to decrease the incidence of delirium. Hospital delirium has many contributors, and the reduction in vital signs checking, although statistically significant, was relatively small,\" according to the editorialists.\nThe authors concluded, \"Results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that the model we have described herein, a predictive algorithm that identifies clinically stable patients for whom a hospital intervention can be safely discontinued, has potential applications beyond measurement of vital signs. Continuous cardiac monitoring, higher level of care, and routine daily blood tests are all scenarios that could benefit from a similar approach.\"\nFor further information:\nDOI:10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.7387",

However, the researchers suggest that public health strategies, while developing population-wide interventions, should consider the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in this study population. The study was published in the JAMA Network Open on December 28, 2021.\nPatients with psychotic disorders are at an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is evident during first-episode psychosis (FEP) and is related to unfavorable mental and physical health outcomes. Fiona Gaughran, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK, and colleagues aimed to examine whether vitamin D supplementation contributes to improved clinical outcomes in FEP in the DFEND --a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial from the UK.\nThe trial examined adults aged 18 to 65 years of age within 3 years of a first presentation with a functional psychotic disorder who had no contraindication to vitamin D supplementation. 2136 were assessed for eligibility, 835 were approached, 686 declined participation or were excluded. 149 were randomized (monthly augmentation with 120 000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo) and 104 were followed at 6 months. The participants were recruited from January 19, 2016, to June 14, 2019, and the final follow-up (after the last dose) was completed on December 20, 2019.\nThe study recruited participants from January 19, 2016, to June 14, 2019, with the final follow-up (after the last dose) completed on December 20, 2019.\nThe primary outcome was the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score at 6 months.\nSecondary outcomes included total PANSS score at 3 months; PANSS positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscale scores at 3 and 6 months; Calgary Depression Scale score, waist circumference, body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and vitamin D concentrations at 6 months; Global Assessment of Function scores (for symptoms and disability; and planned sensitivity analysis in those with insufficient vitamin D levels at baseline.\nBased on the study, the researchers found the following:\nNo differences were observed in the intention-to-treat analysis in the primary outcome, total PANSS score at 6 months (mean difference, 3.57), or the secondary outcomes at 3 and 6 months (PANSS positive subscore: mean difference, −0.98 at 3 months; mean difference, 0.68 at 6 months; PANSS negative subscore: mean difference, 0.68 at 3 months; mean difference, 1.56 at 6 months; and general psychopathology subscore: mean difference, −2.09 at 3 months; mean difference, 1.31 at 6 months).\nThere also were no significant differences in the Global Assessment of Function symptom score (mean difference, 0.02); Global Assessment of Function disability score (mean difference, −0.01), or Calgary Depression Scale score (mean difference, −0.39) at 6 months.\nVitamin D levels were very low in the study group, especially in Black participants and those who identified as another minoritized racial and ethnic group, 57 of 61 (93.4%) of whom had insufficient vitamin D.\nThe treatment was safe and led to a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.\n\"The results showed no association between vitamin D supplementation and mental health or metabolic outcomes at 6 months,\" wrote the authors.\"This suggests that the group would benefit from active consideration in future population health strategies as few patients with FEP were vitamin D replete.\"\nReference:\nGaughran F, Stringer D, Wojewodka G, et al.

            "content": "Sweden: A recent review published in Best Practice & Research Clinical Anaesthesiology has highlighted the evolution of recommendations and guidelines regarding preoperative fasting in children and the supporting evidence behind these changes.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe review by Peter Frykholm, Uppsala Centre for Paediatric Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Research, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, and colleagues explores the development of preoperative fasting guidelines and evaluate the incidence of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, along with recommended treatment approaches.\nAdvertisement\nSince 1994, nine guidelines developed by professional societies and published in peer-reviewed journals have been identified regarding preoperative fasting in pediatric anesthesia. Over the past three decades, recommendations for fasting across various categories have seen only minor adjustments.\nThe review also identified twelve studies on the incidence of pulmonary aspiration, reporting rates ranging from 0.6 to 12 cases per 10,000 anesthetics in children. This variation is influenced by differing definitions of aspiration and variations in study design. Key risk factors associated with pulmonary aspiration include emergency surgery, ASA physical status, and patient age. Additionally, non-compliance with fasting guidelines has been noted as a potential risk factor.\nInterestingly, the duration of fasting from clear fluids does not appear to be linked to an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration, suggesting that this finding may inform future updates to guidelines in pediatric anesthesia.\nAccording to the research, the following were the practice points:\nLow Mortality Risk: Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in healthy children does not result in mortality.\nDeclining Incidence: The rate of aspiration requiring escalation of care or intensive care has decreased significantly over the past 30 years, by one order of magnitude.\nClear Fluid Safety: Aspiration of clear fluids consumed before anesthesia has not been linked to significant morbidity or mortality.\nRisk Factor Identification: Identifying patients with aspiration risk factors and adjusting the airway management plan accordingly may be the most effective strategy to prevent pulmonary aspiration.\nImmediate Response: Prompt recognition and management of regurgitation during all phases of anesthesia—induction, maintenance, and emergence—are crucial for minimizing potential harm to patients.\nThe study revealed that pulmonary aspiration of clear gastric contents in children is rare and typically does not result in complications. Over the past 50 years, only two reported cases have linked aspiration to fatalities. The incidence of pulmonary aspiration requiring postoperative intensive care has significantly decreased, now ranging from 0.2 to 3 cases per 10,000 anesthetics, marking a reduction of one order of magnitude. Similarly, instances of aspiration that necessitate escalated care—such as unplanned admissions, supplemental oxygen beyond the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), or antibiotic treatment—have also declined, with reported rates between 0.4 and 3 cases per 10,000.\nFurthermore, regurgitation leading to transient symptoms, including intraoperative desaturation, coughing, or the need for suctioning of regurgitated gastric contents, occurs at an incidence of 0.6 to 10 cases per 10,000.\nWhile preoperative fasting for solids remains critical, recent findings suggest that clear fluids can be consumed closer to induction than previously recommended. Introducing new fasting guidelines, which advocate for a one-hour limit on clear fluid intake, is safe and effective in minimizing fasting durations.\n\"Nevertheless, even with adherence to fasting guidelines, ensuring a completely empty stomach in pediatric patients remains uncertain. Therefore, the anesthesia team must remain vigilant regarding the risk factors associated with aspiration, recognizing that clear fluid fasting duration does not appear to be one of them. Prompt identification and management of regurgitation during all phases of anesthesia—induction, maintenance, and emergence—are essential to mitigate potential patient harm,\" the researchers concluded.\nReference:\nFrykholm, P., Hansen, T.

            "content": "Airway blockage poses a critical emergency and poses substantial challenges for healthcare providers, as effectively managing this condition requires precise decision-making. Numerous patients with airway obstruction necessitate interventions beyond the confines of the operating room, each carrying distinct risks. Recent paper investigated factors associated with emergency interventions in acute airway obstructive diseases (AAODs) in internal medicine conditions. The study was a retrospective observational single-center study that included 150 patients admitted to Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital, Japan, for AAOD between April 2012 and March 2022. The study aimed to identify predictors for emergency interventions such as intubation, cricothyroidotomy, and tracheostomy in patients with AAODs.\nAdvertisement\nResults revealed several significant findings from univariate analysis, including age, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, stridor, dysphagia, drooling, frequent suctions, airway examination abnormalities (AEAs), and diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that AEA, upper airway diseases, and SOFA score were predictors for intervention, with AEA being associated with the highest risk for airway interventions. However, the study found that the sensitivity and specificity of AEA were insufficient.\nDiseases and Predictive Factors\nThe paper also discussed various diseases that can lead to airway emergencies, such as acute epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, Lemierre's syndrome, hemoptysis, and airway foreign body. It highlighted the importance of thorough physical examinations in predicting airway interventions and the need for accurate diagnostic methods in emergency settings.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLimitations and Further Research\nThe authors mentioned the limitations of the study, including its retrospective nature and the need for a multicenter study to confirm the results. They also discussed the importance of physical examinations in predicting airway interventions and the need for future prospective studies to overcome the study's limitations.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the paper identified AEA, upper airway diseases, and SOFA score as predictors for emergency interventions in AAOD. However, it highlighted the limitations of these predictors and the need for further research to improve the accuracy of predicting interventions for AAOD.\nKey Points\n- The study investigated factors associated with emergency interventions in acute airway obstructive diseases (AAODs) in internal medicine conditions.\n- It was a retrospective observational single-center study involving 150 patients admitted to Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital, Japan, for AAOD between April 2012 and March 2022.\n- The study aimed to identify predictors for emergency interventions such as intubation, cricothyroidotomy, and tracheostomy in patients with AAODs.\n- Factors associated with emergency interventions included age, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, stridor, dysphagia, drooling, frequent suctions, airway examination abnormalities (AEAs), and diagnosis.\n- AEA, upper airway diseases, and SOFA score were identified as predictors for intervention, with AEA being associated with the highest risk for airway interventions, but with insufficient sensitivity and specificity.\n- Diseases such as acute epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, Lemierre's syndrome, hemoptysis, and airway foreign body were discussed as conditions leading to airway emergencies, emphasizing the importance of thorough physical examinations and the need for accurate diagnostic methods in emergency settings.\nReference -\nSuzuki N, Doi T, Abe T, et al.

            "content": "Denmark: In a pivotal sub-study of the DanGer Shock randomized clinical trial, researchers have unveiled significant findings regarding the use of Microaxial Flow Pumps (MAFP) in patients suffering from infarct-related cardiogenic shock (CS) due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe study, published in JAMA Cardiology, revealed that using MAFP decreases the need for vasopressors and inotropic medications while ensuring hemodynamic stability and promoting quicker normalization of lactate levels in this critically ill patient population.\nAdvertisement\nCardiogenic shock, characterized by the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood, often results from a severe heart attack and poses a high risk of mortality. Traditional management strategies include aggressive fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents to support heart function. However, these methods can be limited and often result in variable patient responses.\nMechanical circulatory support using an MAFP has demonstrated improved survival rates in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock due to STEMI-CS. Understanding its effects on hemodynamic stability over time is essential for optimizing treatment strategies for these patients. Considering this, Nanna Louise Junker Udesen, Department of Cardiology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark, and colleagues assessed whether an MAFP decreases the reliance on pharmacological circulatory support while maintaining hemodynamic stability compared to standard care in patients with STEMI-related cardiogenic shock.\nFor this purpose, the researchers conducted a substudy of the Danish-German (DanGer) Shock trial, an international, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial involving patients from 14 heart centers across Denmark, Germany, and the UK. Participants included those with STEMI, systolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg or receiving vasopressor treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction under 45%, and arterial lactate levels exceeding 2.5 mmol/L. After excluding patients who died in the catheterization lab or upon ICU admission, the remaining participants had serial hemodynamic, arterial lactate, and vasoactive drug use recordings. Those in comas post-cardiac arrest and those with mechanical complications or right ventricular failure were also excluded.\nPatients received either an MAFP combined with standard care or standard care alone. The main outcomes assessed included hemodynamic status (heart rate and blood pressure), metabolic status (arterial lactate concentration), and vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS). Clinical events monitored during the first 72 hours included overall mortality, escalation of mechanical circulatory support, and discharge alive from the ICU.\nThe following were the key findings of the study:\nAmong the 355 enrolled patients, 324 underwent ICU treatment, with 52% in the MAFP group and 48% in the standard care group.\nThe mean age of patients was 68 years, with 80% being male.\nBaseline characteristics were similar between the two groups.\nNo significant difference in heart rate was observed between groups.\nMean arterial pressure exceeded the treatment target of 65 mm Hg in both groups, achieved with a lower VIS in the MAFP group.\nAt randomization, no difference in arterial lactate levels was found; however, upon ICU arrival, the MAFP group had significantly lower lactate levels than the standard-care group (mean difference of 1.3 mmol/L).\nThis difference in lactate levels persisted throughout the first 24 hours.\nThe MAFP group achieved lactate normalization (<2 mmol/L) 12 hours earlier than the standard care group.\nThe findings from the substudy of the DanGer Shock randomized clinical trial indicate that the use of a Microaxial Flow Pump (MAFP) effectively reduced the reliance on vasopressors and inotropes, all while maintaining hemodynamic stability and facilitating quicker normalization of lactate levels.\n\"These results highlight the device's capability to support circulation with a reduced need for pharmacological intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\nReference:\nUdesen NLJ, Beske RP, Hassager C, et al.

The study included 30 patients scheduled for elective breast surgeries less than 90 minutes long. Group I received TSA while Group II received standard GA. The primary outcome was time to first rescue analgesic, and secondary outcomes were time to recovery, patient satisfaction, and cost.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nThe results showed the time to first rescue analgesic was significantly longer in the TSA group compared to the GA group (336 vs. 188 minutes, p=0.001).

            "content": "A new, computerized, mental health assessment tool may allow doctors to quickly identify children experiencing anxiety or depression before surgery, suggests new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2024 annual meeting. In the small, single-center study, researchers found more than half of the children screened had anxiety before having surgery and more than one-third had depression.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The use of the KCAT® tool in pediatric patients in the preoperative setting is very feasible and the results of our pilot study show a substantial prevalence of these mental health conditions in this surgical population,” said Elizabeth Pealy, M.D., lead author of the study and assistant professor of anesthesia and critical care at the University of Chicago Medicine. “Anxiety and depression are caused by many factors. Many kids are anxious before having surgery and the stress of undergoing the actual procedure can accentuate it.”\nAdvertisement\nThe overall incidence and prevalence of anxiety and depression in children in the United States has dramatically increased in recent years. It is difficult for pediatric anesthesiologists to determine if patients have undiagnosed anxiety or depression, or severe preoperative anxiety, prior to the surgery. Increased anxiety can contribute to the child being uncooperative during the anesthetic induction, as well as prolonged recovery, increased postoperative pain and delirium, and decreased patient satisfaction. With thousands of children undergoing surgery every year, having a comprehensive yet quick method to screen for these conditions is needed.\nIn the study, researchers tested the feasibility of administering KCAT-a computerized adaptive mental health assessment tool — on pediatric surgical patients in the preoperative holding area and examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression in this group. According to the authors, KCAT allows for quick and accurate assessment of anxiety and depression without the need for a trained clinician interviewer. It is administered on a tablet device and allows for real-time assessment in the perioperative setting.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSixty-five children scheduled for elective surgery at a large children’s hospital were enrolled. The median age was 13 years old (range 7-18 years). All of the children completed the assessment (taking an average of two minutes and 13 seconds), with 15 receiving parental assistance. The researchers found 57% of patients screened positive for anxiety and 34% of patients screened positive for depression.\n“This is the first study to examine the use of this tool on children in this setting,” said Sarah Nizamuddin, M.D., co-author of the study and associate professor of anesthesia and critical care at the University of Chicago Medicine. “The ability to rapidly assess for and capture anxiety and depression levels can allow providers to offer a variety of anxiety-reducing options prior to and after surgery to the patients who would benefit the most. Further studies should aim to determine how to use the information to better cater to the needs of pediatric patients to improve their experience during surgery.”\nReference:\nEasy-to-use tool helps screen for anxiety, depression in children having surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Meeting: Anesthesiology 2024",

            "content": "People who experience poor sleep in the month before surgery may be more likely to develop postoperative delirium, according to new research being presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2024 annual meeting.\nPostoperative delirium is a change in mental function that can cause confusion and occurs in up to 15% of surgical patients. In certain high-risk patients, such as those with hip fractures, the incidence can be even higher. It is a significant complication in older adults. Pain, age, stress, anxiety and insomnia are known to contribute to the risk for postoperative delirium. The researchers believe this study is the first to assess sleep quality before surgery as it relates to postoperative delirium.\nAdvertisement\n“Good sleep quality before surgery is crucial for the recovery period,” said Faegheh Miryousefiata, M.D., MPH, lead author of the study and clinical researcher at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Outcomes Research Consortium. “People may not get good sleep because they are nervous right before surgery, but it is really important to get the best sleep possible, especially for those over 65, who are at greater risk for postoperative delirium.”\nThe study included 150 patients having general anesthesia for non-cardiac surgeries, mostly abdominal and gynecologic procedures, of more than two hours. The day before the surgery, the researchers had the patients assess their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which evaluates sleep duration, disturbance, efficiency and overall quality, length of time to fall asleep, daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness and use of sleep medication. Scores for each category range from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty), with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. A score of 5 or above indicated poor sleep. After surgery, they assessed postoperative delirium using the Intensive Care Unit Confusion Assessment Method (ICU-CAM) and the Three-minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM). They checked patients’ hospital records for three days after surgery for postoperative delirium.\nResearchers determined:\n44 patients had poor sleep and 11 of those (25%) experienced delirium\n106 patients had good sleep and 19 of those (17.9%) experienced delirium\nWhen comparing all patients who experienced delirium, there was a 39.66% higher rate of delirium among those who had poor sleep, compared to those who had good sleep\n“Doctors should make it their mission to let patients know it’s important to get good sleep before surgery to protect their brains, as well as provide some tips,” said Yasin Tire, M.D., senior author of the study and an anesthesiologist at Konya City Hospital, University of Health Science, Konya, Turkey.\nTo improve sleep quality in general, as well as before surgery, the researchers recommend:\nGoing to bed and waking up at the same time every day\nCreating a bedtime ritual, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or practicing relaxation techniques\nKeeping the bedroom cool, dark and quiet\nAvoiding phones, tablets and computers at least an hour before bed\nStaying active during the day, but not exercising too close to bedtime\nUsing stress-management techniques such as mindfulness or deep breathing\nReference:\nPoor sleep quality raises the risk of delirium after surgery, study finds, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Meeting: Anesthesiology 2024.",

            "content": "Propofol has been utilized in the medical field as an anesthetic agent for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia due to its benefits. Nevertheless, it is associated with limitations such as pain upon injection. A new anaesthetic drug called ciprofol has recently garnered attention as a potential solution to address several drawbacks linked to propofol. Recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the anesthetic and sedative efficacy and safety of ciprofol compared to propofol in adult patients undergoing various procedures. The analysis included 19 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2,841 participants. The key findings are as follows:\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nEfficacy\nEfficacy: There was no significant difference between ciprofol and propofol in the success rate of endoscopy procedures. However, ciprofol showed a small but statistically significant increase in the success rate of general anesthesia/sedation induction compared to propofol. There were also no differences between the two drugs in induction time, time to eyelash reflex disappearance, insertion time, or discharge time. Ciprofol did show a significantly longer awakening time compared to propofol.\nSafety\nADVERTISEMENT\nSafety: Ciprofol demonstrated significantly less pain on injection compared to propofol. Ciprofol also had a significantly lower incidence of adverse events overall compared to propofol, though there was no difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two drugs.\nPatient and Provider Satisfaction\nPatient and provider satisfaction: Ciprofol showed significantly higher patient satisfaction compared to propofol, though there was no difference in anesthesiologist satisfaction between the two drugs.\nVital Signs\nVital signs: Ciprofol was associated with a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to propofol, though there were no differences in other vital signs like heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation.\nConclusion\nIn summary, this comprehensive meta-analysis found that ciprofol exhibited comparable efficacy to propofol in inducing general anesthesia and sedation, with some advantages in terms of reduced injection pain, fewer adverse events, and higher patient satisfaction. These findings suggest that ciprofol may be a viable alternative to propofol for anesthesia and sedation in various clinical settings. However, the authors note the need for further research, particularly studies conducted outside of China, to confirm these results and establish broader clinical guidelines for the use of ciprofol.\nKey Points\n1. Efficacy: There was no significant difference between ciprofol and propofol in the success rate of endoscopy procedures, but ciprofol showed a small but statistically significant increase in the success rate of general anesthesia/sedation induction compared to propofol. There were also no differences between the two drugs in induction time, time to eyelash reflex disappearance, insertion time, or discharge time, though ciprofol did show a significantly longer awakening time.\n2. Safety: Ciprofol demonstrated significantly less pain on injection compared to propofol and had a significantly lower incidence of adverse events overall, though there was no difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two drugs.\n3. Patient and Provider Satisfaction: Ciprofol showed significantly higher patient satisfaction compared to propofol, though there was no difference in anesthesiologist satisfaction between the two drugs.\n4. Vital Signs: Ciprofol was associated with a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to propofol, though there were no differences in other vital signs like heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation.\n5.

            "content": "During general anesthesia, for specific surgeries performed with patients in the prone position, there is often an increase in airway pressures and a decrease in pulmonary and thoracic compliance, leading to limited chest expansion. This can impact cardiac output and venous return, affecting overall hemodynamic stability. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is utilized to alleviate these concerns by enhancing lung recruitment and ventilation and minimizing strain on the lungs. Recent study aimed to evaluate the effects of different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels (0 cmH2O, 5 cmH2O, and 10 cmH2O) on respiratory parameters in patients undergoing spine surgery in the prone position under general anesthesia.\nAdvertisement\nThe study was a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial that enrolled 90 patients scheduled for elective spine fixation surgeries. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group A (PEEP 0), Group B (PEEP 5), and Group C (PEEP 10). Standardized anesthesia protocols were administered, with ventilation set to pressure-controlled mode at the desired PEEP levels. The key findings were: 1. Arterial oxygenation was significantly higher in Groups B (PEEP 5) and C (PEEP 10) compared to Group A (PEEP 0) at both 30 minutes post-intubation and post-extubation. Specifically, at 30 minutes post-intubation, arterial oxygenation was 142.26 ±24.7 in Group B and 154.9 ±29.88 in Group C, compared to 128.18 ±13.3 in Group A (p=0.002). 2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly in Groups B and C compared to Group A. 3. Dynamic compliance was improved in Groups B and C compared to Group A. 4. Intraoperative blood loss was notably lower in Group C (329.66 ±93.93) and Group B (421.16 ±104.52) compared to Group A (466.66 ±153.76), and these differences were statistically significant.\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that higher levels of PEEP (10 and 5 cmH2O) during prone positioning in spine surgery improve arterial oxygenation, dynamic compliance, and hemodynamic stability while reducing intraoperative blood loss. The study emphasizes the importance of optimizing ventilatory support to enhance patient outcomes during prone-position surgeries. Proper titration of PEEP levels is crucial to balance the benefits of improved respiratory function against potential hemodynamic effects.\nADVERTISEMENT\nKey Points\n1. Arterial oxygenation was significantly higher in the groups with PEEP of 5 cmH2O (Group B) and 10 cmH2O (Group C) compared to the group with 0 cmH2O PEEP (Group A), both at 30 minutes post-intubation and post-extubation.\n2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly in the groups with PEEP of 5 cmH2O (Group B) and 10 cmH2O (Group C) compared to the group with 0 cmH2O PEEP (Group A).\n3. Dynamic compliance was improved in the groups with PEEP of 5 cmH2O (Group B) and 10 cmH2O (Group C) compared to the group with 0 cmH2O PEEP (Group A).\n4. Intraoperative blood loss was notably lower in the group with PEEP of 10 cmH2O (Group C) and the group with PEEP of 5 cmH2O (Group B) compared to the group with 0 cmH2O PEEP (Group A), and these differences were statistically significant.\n5. The findings suggest that higher levels of PEEP (10 and 5 cmH2O) during prone positioning in spine surgery improve arterial oxygenation, dynamic compliance, and hemodynamic stability while reducing intraoperative blood loss.\n6.

            "content": "A simple blood test could help doctors identify women in labor who are at risk for preeclampsia-a leading cause of maternal death-and take precautions to prevent it, according to research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2024 annual meeting.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBetween 5% and 10% of pregnant women develop preeclampsia (sudden high blood pressure and protein in the urine), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Black women are 60% more likely to develop preeclampsia than white women, and more likely to die or have serious outcomes such as kidney damage, the CDC notes. While preeclampsia can develop as early as the 20th week of pregnancy, the study focused on identifying women who were at risk for preeclampsia when they were admitted to the hospital in labor.\nAdvertisement\nResearchers have determined doctors can predict a woman’s risk of developing preeclampsia by calculating the ratio of two blood proteins-fibrinogen and albumin-measured in routine blood tests done when women in labor enter the hospital. Fibrinogen is involved in blood clotting and inflammation, while albumin helps maintain fluid balance and carries hormones, vitamins and enzymes throughout the body. Both can be disrupted with preeclampsia-fibrinogen may be elevated, albumin may be reduced, or both can occur.\nThere is no universally established normal value for this fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), which can range from 0.05 to 1 or higher. Higher FAR values are often associated with increased inflammation, infection or serious health conditions, and the higher the FAR, the greater the concern. This trend has been consistently seen when FAR is used to evaluate other inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory bowel disease.\nAdvertisement\nIn the study, researchers analyzed the records of 2,629 women who gave birth between 2018 and 2024, 1,819 who did not have preeclampsia, 584 who had preeclampsia with mild features or symptoms (including blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, but no significant signs of organ damage), and 226 who had preeclampsia with severe features or symptoms (including blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg or higher and signs of organ damage, including severe headaches, high liver enzymes, visual disturbances, low platelet count or kidney impairment). The researchers determined those who had a higher FAR were more likely to develop preeclampsia than those with a lower FAR. They found that the predicted likelihood of developing any degree of preeclampsia was 24% for patients with a FAR of at least 0.1 on admission to the hospital, and it rose to more than 41% when that value was above 0.3.\nIf a woman in labor is found to be at increased risk for preeclampsia based on the FAR and other clinical indicators-such as being older than 35 or having chronic high blood pressure or obesity-obstetricians and anesthesiologists can take extra precautions to reduce the risk and ensure the patient’s blood pressure and fluid levels remain stable and controlled. For example, they can order more frequent blood pressure checks or lab tests. If the FAR indicates a woman is at risk for preeclampsia with severe symptoms, an epidural for pain management can be placed early before it becomes too risky.\n“While FAR has been associated with other inflammatory conditions, its specific application to preeclampsia and preeclampsia with severe symptoms has not been reported in a group this large and racially diverse,” said Lucy Shang, B.A., lead author of the study and a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. “Our study shows that FAR can be a predictive tool that gives anesthesiologists and obstetricians a new method for assessing a laboring mom’s risk of developing preeclampsia when they are admitted to the hospital.”\nShe noted that while this ratio should be assessed for all pregnant women, calculating the FAR is especially important for women who are at higher risk for preeclampsia, such as Black women and those with high blood pressure and obesity. “Additional research is needed to determine the exact range of the FAR that would be considered concerning and would be helpful to incorporate into routine prenatal care as a predictive tool for early identification of preeclampsia,” she said.\nReference:\nRoutine blood test can identify laboring women at risk for preeclampsia, prompt interventions to protect mom and baby, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Meeting: Anesthesiology 2024.",

Adding a small amount of naloxone to intrathecal opioids can reduce the high risk of pruritis associated with their use. Recent study evaluated the effect of adding a low dose of naloxone (20 μg) to a fentanyl-bupivacaine mixture on the incidence of pruritus in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The study included 80 pregnant patients scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.

The study suggests that administering an oral carbohydrate drink two hours before surgery can enhance clinical outcomes, providing a safer approach for patients.\n\"An oral carbohydrate (CHO) drink is safe to administer two hours before uncomplicated elective cesarean deliveries and may positively impact various perioperative clinical outcome markers,\" the researchers wrote in the Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology.\nAdvertisement\nLong periods of fasting during the third trimester of pregnancy can be harmful, as they may cause hypoglycemia, elevated free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and increased ketones in the blood and urine. In these cases, preoperative carbohydrate-rich drinks may help. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines suggest offering oral CHO fluid supplementation to nondiabetic pregnant women two hours before a cesarean delivery.\nAgainst the above background, Ankita Sharma, Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Bathinda, Punjab, India, and colleagues aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative oral CHO loading in preventing perioperative ketoacidosis during elective cesarean deliveries.\nFor this purpose, the researchers enrolled 120 parturients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II/III who were undergoing elective cesarean sections with subarachnoid block (SAB). After providing written informed consent, the participants were divided into two groups of 60. Group A received 400 ml of filtered water two hours before surgery, while Group B received 400 ml of a nonparticulate CHO drink.\nAdvertisement\nThe primary outcome measured was the incidence of ketonuria, assessed using the dipstick method. Secondary outcomes included hunger and thirst scores, anxiety levels, dominant hand grip strength, and the quality of recovery scores.\nThe following were the key findings of the study:\nUrine ketone levels were positive (+1) in 8.3% of participants in Group A, compared to only 1.7% in the carbohydrate (CHO) group.\nThe CHO group also reported significantly lower hunger and thirst scores and modified Beck’s anxiety scores.\nDominant hand grip strength remained stable in both groups.\nThe quality of recovery score was significantly higher in the CHO group.\nNo serious adverse effects were observed in either group.\nThe researchers wrote, \"From our results, we conclude that allowing clear fluids or a nonparticulate carbohydrate drink up to two hours before surgery is safe for the parturient. This practice may help improve preoperative discomfort related to hunger, thirst, and anxiety.\"\nThey further noted, \"the quality of recovery regarding postoperative experiences such as pain, nausea, vomiting, and overall comfort improved with CHO loading. Thus, administering oral CHO drinks before surgery is safe for elective cesarean deliveries and may positively influence perioperative clinical outcomes.\"\nReference:\nSharma A, Singh U, Kaur G, Grewal A, Maingi S, Tidyal S.

This timeframe can be prolonged by incorporating additional agents like opioids, ketamine, α2 agonists, and adrenaline. Recent research paper examined the use of adjuvants, specifically fentanyl, to extend the duration of pain relief provided by a single injection of the local anesthetic ropivacaine as a caudal epidural block. The study aimed to compare the quality and duration of pain relief using a combination of caudal epidural ropivacaine and fentanyl versus using ropivacaine alone in patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries.\nAdvertisement\nThe study included 56 ASA grade I and II patients who were randomly divided into two groups. Group R received 20 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine, while Group RF received 20 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine combined with 50 micrograms of fentanyl as a caudal epidural block. The results showed that the addition of fentanyl to the ropivacaine injection significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia. The mean time until the first rescue analgesia was required was 7.30 hours in the RF group compared to 6.68 hours in the R group. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were also lower in the RF group throughout the 24-hour postoperative period, with a maximum VAS of 5.87 at 4 hours compared to 5.96 at 6 hours in the R group.\nComparison of Analgesia\nThe intraoperative fentanyl requirement was similar between the two groups. However, in the postoperative period, the total amount of rescue analgesia (fentanyl, diclofenac, and tramadol) administered was comparable between the groups. No adverse effects or complications related to the caudal block or the administered drugs were observed in either group.\nADVERTISEMENT\nStudy Conclusion\nThe study concludes that the addition of 50 micrograms of fentanyl to 20 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine for ultrasound-guided caudal epidural block in patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries results in longer duration of analgesia and lower VAS scores over the postoperative 24 hours, without increasing the incidence of adverse effects.\nImplications of the Findings\nThe findings suggest that the combination of ropivacaine and fentanyl as a caudal epidural block provides superior postoperative pain relief compared to ropivacaine alone in patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries. This technique can be a valuable tool in managing postoperative pain and improving patient outcomes in this patient population.\nKey Points\n1. The study examined the use of the adjuvant fentanyl to extend the duration of pain relief provided by a single injection of the local anesthetic ropivacaine as a caudal epidural block in patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries.\n2.

The results showed that the addition of fentanyl to the ropivacaine injection significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia, with the mean time until the first rescue analgesia being 7.30 hours in the RF group compared to 6.68 hours in the R group. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were also lower in the RF group throughout the 24-hour postoperative period.\n4.

            "content": "France: A recent editorial published in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain Medicine explores the multifaceted role of dexmedetomidine, posing the question: Is it more than just an anesthetic aid? The article provides an overview of the latest evidence regarding this highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, highlighting its potential benefits beyond traditional anesthetic applications.\nAdvertisement\nDexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 agonist recognized for its analgesic, sedative, and anti-anxiolytic properties, all with minimal respiratory depression. Recently, its organ-protective and anti-inflammatory effects have gained attention. Traditionally, dexmedetomidine has played an adjunctive role in anesthesia, helping to reduce the need for hypnotic agents, facilitating opioid-free anesthesia, and improving postoperative outcomes related to nausea, vomiting, delirium, and pain.\nEmerging research highlights additional potential benefits, such as reducing postoperative sleep disturbances and acute kidney injury (AKI), both of which are associated with inflammation. These issues are prevalent in surgical settings and can lead to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and heightened patient distress.\nThis raises the question: does the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine offer more than just anesthetic support? Beyond its traditional role, it may positively influence the physiological and emotional outcomes of surgery.\nIn their article, Raphael Cinotti, MethodS in Patients-centered Outcomes and HEalth Research, SPHERE, Nantes, France, and colleagues present a comprehensive overview of dexmedetomidine regarding sleep disturbances and acute kidney injury while also offering a broader perspective on its effects during perioperative administration.\nTwo recent studies have shed light on the role of dexmedetomidine in addressing postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and sleep disturbances.\nIn a meta-analysis by Zhuang et al., which reviewed 23 randomized control trials, compelling evidence emerged linking intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine—either as a bolus (0.4 to 1.5 mg/kg) or continuous infusion (0.1 to 1 mg/kg/h)—to a reduction in postoperative AKI, assessed by established criteria. This study highlighted secondary benefits, including improved urine output, inflammation markers, and overall renal function, alongside reduced nausea and vomiting. Although some secondary outcomes received low-GRADE scores, the primary findings on AKI received high GRADE ratings, reinforcing the drug's potential renal protective effects.\nMeanwhile, Dong et al. conducted a double-blind randomized control trial focusing on postoperative sleep disturbances in women undergoing breast surgery. Utilizing a clinical insomnia scale and Fitbit data for sleep analysis, the study found no significant difference in sleep disturbance between those receiving dexmedetomidine (1.0 mg/kg before induction) and a placebo. However, improvements in sleep structure—specifically nocturnal wakefulness and deep sleep—were noted with dexmedetomidine across different anesthesia regimens.\nWhile these studies suggest dexmedetomidine's potential in mitigating AKI and enhancing sleep quality, they also raise questions about dosing protocols and the consistency of results. There were increased incidences of hypotension and bradycardia, although some literature suggests dexmedetomidine might present a safer profile compared to traditional opioids like remifentanil.\nTo conclude, the findings of Zhuang et al. and Dong et al. provide valuable insights into dexmedetomidine's effects on AKI and sleep disturbances. However, further research is needed to clarify optimal dosing and timing and to explore its impact across diverse patient populations.\nReference:\nCinotti R, Studd H, Forget P.

            "content": "USA: A recent editorial published in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia offers valuable insights into the AMIKINHAL Trial and provides an update on strategies for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).\nADVERTISEMENT\nVentilator-associated pneumonia remains a significant challenge in critical care settings, affecting an estimated 5% to 40% of patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. The incidence of VAP can vary widely based on factors, including geographic location, patient demographics, and diagnostic criteria. The condition is often caused by a range of pathogens, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus spp.\nAdvertisement\nThe emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms complicates the clinical landscape, especially in certain patient populations with specific risk factors. VAP is linked to numerous negative outcomes, including increased hospital costs, extended lengths of stay, longer durations of mechanical ventilation, and elevated mortality rates. Additionally, inappropriate or excessive antimicrobial use can lead to further complications, including adverse effects and increased resistance.\nIn light of these challenges, the AMIKINHAL trial offers promising insights into the prevention of VAP. The clinical study investigates the efficacy of inhaled aminoglycosides in preventing the onset of VAP in mechanically ventilated patients. By targeting pathogens directly in the lungs, inhaled treatments aim to reduce the incidence of VAP and its associated complications.\nAccording to the article, ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a critical challenge in intensive care units, impacting a significant number of patients on mechanical ventilation. In response to this issue, preventive “bundles” of interventions have been developed over the past two decades. Initially introduced by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), these bundles included head-of-bed elevation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and sedation interruptions. The Intensive Care Society (ICS) later expanded on these interventions by incorporating evidence-based practices such as daily spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), which have shown promise in reducing VAP rates.\nA significant development in VAP prevention is the use of inhaled antimicrobials. The AMIKINHAL trial explored the effectiveness of inhaled amikacin in preventing VAP. The multicenter, double-blind trial, conducted across 19 French ICUs, involved patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours. Results indicated a lower incidence of VAP in patients receiving amikacin compared to placebo (15% versus 22%). While these findings are encouraging, the limitations of the trial included a potential overestimation of VAP incidence due to sensitive diagnostic criteria.\nThe AMIKINHAL trial highlights the potential of inhaled antibiotics to deliver high drug concentrations directly to the lungs, potentially reducing bacterial burden without the systemic side effects commonly associated with traditional antibiotics. However, the number needed to treat (NNT) suggests that broader adoption may be limited, especially in settings with lower VAP rates.\n\"Future research should refine VAP diagnostic criteria and explore alternative antibiotics and innovative nonpharmacologic interventions. Recent evidence points to the effectiveness of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and early mobilization, which may offer additional strategies for reducing VAP incidence. Overall, the AMIKINHAL trial serves as a vital step forward in the ongoing effort to enhance VAP prevention and improve patient outcomes in critical care settings,\" the article concluded.\nReference:\nPaul J, Patel M, Moitra V.

            "content": "It is crucial to provide excellent hospital care during labor and delivery to decrease avoidable maternal morbidity and mortality. The latest MBRRACE-UK report found that while deaths directly linked to anesthesia are uncommon, enhancing the overall peripartum care provided to 38% of those who passed away between 2018 and 2020 could have impacted the outcome, as only 22% received high-quality care. Recent study examined the variability in obstetric anesthesia practice and care within the UK's National Health Service. The researchers conducted a survey of 106 out of 107 participating hospitals, representing 69% of all UK obstetric units. The key findings were: Staffing and Training: - 94% of hospitals had a dedicated consultant obstetric anesthetist during working hours, but 25% of out-of-hours duty anesthetists had other clinical commitments outside of obstetrics. - 98% of hospitals offered multidisciplinary team training, mostly using simulation-based methods. Facilities and Resources: - 47% of hospitals had dedicated high-risk antenatal clinics, and 77% provided written patient information on anesthesia options in multiple languages. - 69% used point-of-care testing to estimate hemoglobin concentration.

            "content": "The radial artery is commonly cannulated during the perioperative period and in critical care situations. Despite being invasive, this procedure offers real-time monitoring of arterial blood pressure, enabling clinicians and anesthesiologists to promptly assess and treat patients, as well as to obtain arterial blood samples for various diagnostic purposes such as blood chemistry, blood gas analysis, and coagulation management. Recent study evaluated the impact of arterial cannulation on flow in the radial artery and the ulnar artery in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The primary outcome was to measure the resistive indices (RIs) before cannula insertion and 6 hours after decannulation, while the secondary outcomes included measuring the artery size by anteroposterior (AP) diameter at the insertion site and at a point 4 cm proximal to the insertion site in both the radial and ulnar arteries. The study included 96 patients and used peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end‑diastolic velocity (EDV) to derive RI using a linear ultrasound transducer.\nAdvertisement\nStudy Results\nThe results showed that the flow in the radial artery did not change following cannulation, and the resistive index (RI) and AP diameter at the insertion site and proximal to the insertion site were similar before and after cannulation. However, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and anteroposterior (AP) diameter in the ulnar artery increased significantly after decannulation, indicating a compensatory increase in flow following radial artery decannulation. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with cannulas retained for less than 24 hours showed increased end‑diastolic velocity (EDV) of the radial artery following decannulation, while those with cannulas retained for more than 24 hours showed an increase in PSV and AP diameter of the ulnar artery after decannulation. The study also considered other research findings and discussed the impact of different techniques of radial arterial cannulation on complications. The study acknowledged limitations, such as the inability to document decreased pulsatility of the radial pulse on ultrasound Doppler due to study design constraints and the lack of follow-up beyond 6 hours of decannulation. In conclusion, the study found that resistive indices and artery size in the radial artery did not change significantly following cannulation, while there was a compensatory increase in flow in the ulnar artery after decannulation. The study emphasized the need for further research to evaluate flow patterns at decannulation and extend the measurement period beyond immediate decannulation. Overall, the study provided insight into the impact of arterial cannulation on arterial flow in patients undergoing abdominal surgery and highlighted the need for further research in this area.\nKey Points\nADVERTISEMENT\n- The study aimed to assess the impact of arterial cannulation on flow in the radial and ulnar arteries in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Recent research paper aims to assess the accuracy of various clinical and ultrasonographic parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in the emergency department. The primary objective is to determine the accuracy of ultrasonography parameters compared to Cormack-Lehane grading in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in adults. The secondary objective is to assess the accuracy of clinical parameters compared to Cormack-Lehane grading in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in adults.\nAdvertisement\nStudy Design and Procedure\nThe study will be a prospective cross-sectional study involving 62 adult patients over 18 years who come to the emergency department and require endotracheal intubation. An emergency medicine physician will perform an ultrasonographic examination of the upper airway, measuring the skin-to-epiglottis distance and tongue thickness using a GE Healthcare ultrasound. Clinical airway assessment will also be conducted using the LEMON criteria. A trained emergency medicine physician, unaware of the clinical and ultrasound airway parameters, will perform a laryngoscopy and record the Cormack-Lehane grading. The study is expected to provide insights into the comparative effectiveness of airway ultrasound versus conventional clinical parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy within an emergency department setting. Airway ultrasound has demonstrated significant potential due to its real-time imaging capabilities and ability to visualize anatomical structures that may not be readily accessible through clinical examination alone. Ultrasound parameters such as the distance from the skin to the epiglottis and the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of the hyoid bone and vocal cords have been shown to be effective in predicting difficult laryngoscopy.\nHypothesis and Conclusion\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe researchers hypothesize that airway ultrasound may offer superior predictive value compared to traditional clinical parameters. The integration of ultrasound into airway assessment protocols could revolutionize the approach to managing airways in the emergency department, ensuring that patients receive the best possible care even in the most challenging situations. The conclusion of the study will be drawn regarding the correlation between ultrasound parameters, Cormack-Lehane grading, and clinical parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy.\nKey Points\n1.

            "content": "Ireland: A recent article in Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine explores the key considerations surrounding consent for anesthesia in children and young people.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe legal framework governing consent for medical interventions in children is intricate. In many jurisdictions, children who are deemed mature enough can provide consent on their own. However, the specific regulations surrounding this can differ significantly. When a child is not in a position to consent, approval must be obtained from a person with parental responsibility. This article explores the nuances of consent, including instances of refusal, related to medical treatments involving children, adolescents, and their parents.\nAdvertisement\nThis article provides general information about consent for medical interventions involving children and young people. According to the authors, it is intended for educational purposes and should not be taken as legal opinion or advice. Clinicians facing uncertainty in specific situations are encouraged to consult the relevant authorities within their institution for guidance.\nAccording to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child is defined as anyone under 18. This recognition of children as individuals with rights is reflected in UK and Irish legislation. Children’s rights include being heard and having their views respected, though capacity varies by age. While children can consent to most medical procedures at 16, those under 16 are typically regarded as children, while those aged 16-17 are termed \"young people.\" Doctors must act in the best interests of children, but defining these interests can be complex, requiring consideration of ethical and cultural factors. In uncertain situations, clinicians should seek guidance from experienced colleagues.\nAccording to the article, consent for medical interventions, particularly in anaesthetic practice, is a critical ethical, professional, and legal requirement. Outside of emergencies, treating a child without consent is unlawful. Consent may come from the child if they are mature enough or from a parent/legal guardian if they are not. For consent to be valid, it must meet three criteria: it must be (i) informed, (ii) voluntarily provided, and (iii) given by someone with the capacity and legal authority. Doctors are responsible for delivering all relevant information clearly and comprehensively, ensuring that patients understand their options. Consent should be obtained by a knowledgeable physician who can adequately inform the patient, address questions, and discuss alternative treatments.\n\"Consent for medical treatment of a child or young person can be provided by the competent individual themselves, their parent/legal guardian if they are not, or by a court-authorized person if necessary. In emergencies, treatment may proceed without consent if the child lacks capacity and no guardian is available in time, provided the treatment is essential to save their life or prevent serious harm, known as the Doctrine of Necessity. The legal right to consent varies based on age and jurisdiction,\" Niall Tierney from Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, and colleagues stated.\nReference:\nTierney, N., Casby, C., & Lyons, B.

            "content": "UK: A recent study published in Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine emphasizes the critical need for timely identification and management of patients experiencing severe health deterioration. Critical illness often entails multiple organ failures, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. The research reveals that most patients exhibit recognizable signs of physiological decline before organ failure occurs, yet these warning signs are overlooked, delaying necessary interventions.\nAdvertisement\nDespite ongoing efforts to enhance the detection and management of critical illness, the study indicates that many healthcare providers miss early signs of deterioration. This oversight can result in delays in transferring patients to critical care units, which can be detrimental to patient outcomes. To address these challenges, the study advocates for standardized approaches that implement an effective \"chain of response.\" Such systems are now being adopted worldwide to reduce the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), including in-hospital cardiac arrests and unplanned admissions to intensive care units (ICUs).\nKey components of these systems include the accurate recording of vital signs, recognizing and interpreting abnormal values, and conducting rapid bedside assessments by trained teams. Early warning systems (EWS) are important in identifying patients at risk of deterioration, allowing for timely interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. The study underscores the importance of a structured assessment format, such as the ABCDE approach—airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. This method allows healthcare providers to prioritize life-threatening issues systematically and ensures consistent communication among professionals.\nMoreover, the timely involvement of the critical care team is crucial for making informed decisions about the most appropriate care environment for acutely unwell patients. The study highlights that prompt support and input from critical care experts can significantly enhance outcomes for these vulnerable patients.\nBy focusing on early recognition and escalation of therapy, the study calls for a cultural shift within healthcare settings, encouraging the implementation of structured assessment protocols and early warning systems. This proactive approach aims to foster a more responsive healthcare environment, ultimately leading to improved survival rates and quality of care for critically ill patients.\nOverall, this study stresses the importance of vigilance in recognizing the signs of critical illness and the need for timely intervention to optimize patient outcomes.\nReference:\nBrown, A., Ballal, A., & Al-Haddad, M.

            "content": "The cesarean section (CS) is the most frequently performed obstetric surgery globally. Emergency CS procedures have higher rates of illness and death compared to planned elective CS procedures. The World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Checklist has substantially decreased mortality and underlines the importance of cognitive tools, such as checklists, for evaluating healthcare providers and training residents during emergency situations. Recent research paper focuses on the assessment of preparedness for emergency cesarean sections (CS) using a checklist and an educational intervention as a quality improvement study. The study was conducted in an emergency operating room complex in a hospital in India. The research aimed to assess the preparedness for emergency CS by utilizing a checklist and educational intervention. Approval from the institutional ethics committee was obtained in May 2020.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nMethods and Results\nThe study began with baseline data collection where 65 emergency CS cases were assessed using a 22-action checklist. The mean percentage of completed actions in the baseline period was found to be 78.80%. Following this, educational intervention sessions were conducted for residents of obstetrics and anesthesiology, as well as nursing officers, to emphasize the importance of each step in the checklist. Post-intervention assessment showed an increase in the overall percentage of completed actions to 92.48%. The results indicated that the educational intervention resulted in improved preparedness for emergency CS, as reflected in the positive attitude of the residents towards patient care.\nObservations and Deficiencies\nThe study observed various parameters, including decision-to-delivery time, incidence of intraoperative hypotension, conversion rate from spinal to general anesthesia, and neonatal Apgar scores. The authors also identified deficiencies in their practice through the educational intervention. However, it was noted that the availability of airway adjuncts remained low even after the intervention. The research paper emphasizes the importance of cognitive aids like checklists for the quality improvement of healthcare systems. It also highlights the need for tailored checklists and ongoing improvement cycles. The study did not assess the actual effect of the checklist on patient outcomes and emphasizes that further improvement and multiple improvement cycles would be necessary. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the use of checklists and educational interventions for improving the preparedness for emergency cesarean sections and highlights the need for continued quality improvement efforts in healthcare settings.\nKey Points\n- The study focused on assessing the preparedness for emergency cesarean sections (CS) using a checklist and an educational intervention as a quality improvement study in an emergency operating room complex in a hospital in India.\n- Baseline data collection involved assessing 65 emergency CS cases using a 22-action checklist, with the mean percentage of completed actions in the baseline period found to be 78.80%.

            "content": "India: A recent prospective randomized study has investigated the effects of continuous infusion versus bolus dosing of hydrocortisone in patients experiencing septic shock. The research is particularly significant given the critical role of corticosteroids in managing septic shock, a life-threatening condition often marked by severe infection and systemic inflammation.\nThe researchers demonstrated that continuous infusion and bolus dosing of hydrocortisone have similar effects on blood glucose levels in patients experiencing septic shock. The findings were published online in the Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine on July 11, 2024.\nAdvertisement\nCorticosteroids are advised for use in adult patients with septic shock who need vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. However, this treatment can increase the risk of hyperglycemia, which is linked to worse outcomes. Considering this, Rashmi Salhotra, Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, India, and colleagues conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the effects of continuous infusion versus bolus hydrocortisone on blood glucose levels in patients with septic shock.\nForty adult patients with sepsis and septic shock who required vasopressor support were randomly assigned to either group C, receiving a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone at 200 mg/day, or group B, receiving intermittent bolus doses of hydrocortisone at 50 mg IV every six hours.\nThe study compared several factors, including blood glucose levels (the primary objective), the frequency of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes, daily insulin requirements, the incidence and time to shock reversal, and the nursing workload involved in maintaining blood glucose within the target range of 82-180 mg/dL.\nThe study led to the following findings:\nThe average blood glucose levels were similar between the two groups, with group C at 136.5 ± 22.08 mg/dL and group B at 135.85 ± 19.06 mg/dL.\nAdditionally, the number of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes, daily insulin requirements, and nursing workload were comparable across the groups.\nShock reversal occurred in 35% of patients in the continuous infusion group and 60% in the bolus group.\nThe time to shock reversal and the duration of ICU stay were also statistically similar.\n\"Based on these findings, we conclude that continuous infusion and bolus dosing of hydrocortisone have similar effects on blood glucose control, insulin requirements, and the incidence of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes. Additionally, both treatment regimens are comparable regarding nursing workload, time to shock reversal, ICU mortality, and length of ICU stay,\" the researchers wrote.\nAdding that, \"However, the shock reversal rate appears to be clinically higher with the bolus regimen compared to the continuous infusion. Therefore, further studies to investigate this difference may be warranted.\"\nReference:\nSalhotra R, Sharahudeen A, Tyagi A, Rautela RS, Kemprai R.

            "content": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) commonly occurs within 24 hours after surgery, especially in the post-anaesthesia care unit, and affects nearly 30% of patients worldwide. Recent study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of aprepitant alone, aprepitant plus ondansetron, and aprepitant plus dexamethasone and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to ondansetron alone or combined with dexamethasone. The analysis reviewed 12 studies involving 2729 patients and found that aprepitant alone significantly reduced PONV compared to ondansetron alone, with a PONV incidence of 12.5% vs. 28.5%, and a higher complete response rate. The combination of aprepitant with ondansetron also showed a significantly lower PONV incidence and a higher complete response rate compared to ondansetron alone. Additionally, aprepitant combined with dexamethasone and ondansetron significantly reduced PONV incidence compared to dexamethasone and ondansetron alone.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nConclusion and Limitations\nThe study concluded that aprepitant, whether used alone or in combination with ondansetron or both ondansetron and dexamethasone, consistently outperforms ondansetron in achieving a complete response and reducing the need for rescue therapy during the postoperative period. The systematic review integrated data from various trials and demonstrated the versatility and reliability of aprepitant as a prophylactic antiemetic across diverse surgical contexts and timeframes. The study highlighted the importance of multimodal antiemetic approaches and the potential synergistic effects of combining aprepitant with other drugs for PONV prevention. However, the study acknowledged various limitations, such as heterogeneity among included studies, potential publication bias, and variability in aprepitant dosages and administration routes, which may have influenced the observed efficacy.\nImplications and Further Research\nOverall, the findings emphasized the strong and consistent antiemetic efficacy of aprepitant and suggested the need for continued research to elucidate the true effectiveness of interventions across various postoperative outcomes, thereby informing clinical practice with precision and confidence. The study underscored the critical role of aprepitant in enhancing the overall postoperative experience for patients and emphasized the need for future research to address existing knowledge gaps and improve antiemetic strategies.\nKey Points\n- A systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of aprepitant alone, aprepitant plus ondansetron, and aprepitant plus dexamethasone and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to ondansetron alone or combined with dexamethasone.\n- A total of 12 studies involving 2729 patients were reviewed.

It highlights the potential advantages of adopting innovative methods to improve pain management, decrease opioid use, and ultimately enhance outcomes and satisfaction for living liver donors undergoing hepatectomy.\nAdvertisement\nSpeaking on the study's relevance in the current medical landscape, the lead author, Dr. Ashish Malik, the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in New Delhi, India, shared his insights with Medical Dialogues:\n\"Donor analgesia has been of paramount importance for the development of the living donor liver transplant program, serving as the cornerstone for motivating donation. Multiple methods for providing pain relief have been adopted. This article contributes to discussing the merits and demerits of various techniques and explores how a multimodal approach can be formulated to ensure donor safety.\n\nDr. Malik also highlighted the unique aspects of the study, stating, \"This review article provides in-depth knowledge about all available methods for donor analgesia, based on which a blended approach can be formulated.\" His insights emphasize the comprehensive nature of the research, which aims to enhance pain management strategies for living liver donors.\nThe study authors note that donor hepatectomy is a complex surgical procedure that often leads to considerable postoperative pain, affecting both short-term recovery and long-term outcomes. Effective pain management is essential for the well-being of living liver donors and for optimizing their overall experience. The review by Dr. Malik and the team seeks to offer a thorough overview of current practices and emerging strategies in analgesic management for donor hepatectomy.\nFor this purpose, the team conducted searches on PubMed and Google Scholar to identify relevant materials. Their evaluation included review articles, clinical trials, retrospective studies, observational studies, and case-control studies. The review explores recent advancements in pain management, including enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, personalized analgesic regimens, and innovative pharmaceutical agents. Additionally, it examines the role of psychological factors and patient-centered care in shaping postoperative pain experiences.\nThe review revealed the following findings:\nThe traditional approach to pain management employs a multimodal strategy that combines opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia techniques.\nConcerns about opioid-related side effects and potential complications have led to a re-evaluation of analgesic protocols.\nAlternative methods, such as thoracic epidural analgesia, transversus abdominis plane blocks, and continuous wound infusion systems, are gaining attention for their ability to reduce opioid use and improve recovery outcomes.\nDr. Malik highlighted the implications and key findings of the review, stating that the article aims to enhance recovery after surgery by establishing a standardized approach to pain management. He emphasized the significance of regional anesthesia techniques and the use of novel pharmaceutical agents such as magnesium, dexmedetomidine, gabapentin, and ketamine, all of which can help reduce opioid consumption during these procedures. As surgical methods evolve from open donor hepatectomies to laparoscopic and robotic techniques, these strategies are becoming increasingly relevant.\nHowever, Dr. Malik noted that there is still limited research data in the field of donor analgesia. Randomized controlled trials involving large patient populations are necessary to determine the most effective techniques for managing donor pain. He stressed the importance of focusing future research on acute and chronic pain scores in living donors, as these factors directly influence the quality of life for donors.\nReference:\nMalik, A., & Pal, A.

            "content": "Accurate airway management is crucial in thoracic surgeries, especially those involving lung resections. Achieving ideal lung isolation is vital for patient safety and surgical effectiveness. While double-lumen tubes (DLTs) are now the standard for lung isolation, the task of selecting the right DLT size remains difficult. Recent research paper investigates the use of ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) in measuring cricoid cartilage diameter for objective double-lumen tube (DLT) sizing in thoracic surgeries. The study involves a randomized comparative trial of 120 adult patients undergoing thoracic surgery, grouped into USG, CT, and conventional DLT size determination based on height and gender. The primary outcomes were appropriateness of DLT size, degree of lung collapse, and sore throat. The results indicated improved accuracy of DLT sizing based on cricoid cartilage diameter, with significantly lower rates of inappropriate sizes and better outcomes in lung collapse and sore throat in the USG and CT groups compared to the conventional group.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nMethodology and Tool Exploration\nThe research discusses the challenges of selecting the correct DLT size for thoracic surgeries, a vital aspect of airway management. Factors such as patient height, gender, tracheal diameter, left main bronchial (LMB) diameter, and cricoid cartilage transverse diameter play significant roles in DLT size selection. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are explored as tools for accurately measuring the cricoid cartilage diameter, with advantages such as quick, convenient, safe, and radiation-free assessment of airway anatomy. The study is based on a single-center trial with 120 adult patients, and the primary inclusion criteria were patients undergoing thoracic surgery requiring single-lung ventilation, excluding those with anticipated difficult airways. The results showed that DLT sizing based on cricoid cartilage diameter improved accuracy, with significantly lower rates of inappropriate sizes in the USG and CT groups compared to the conventional group. Lung collapse was also better in the USG and CT groups, with significantly lower rates of sore throat in these groups compared to the conventional group. The study underscores the superiority of USG and CT in DLT measurement over the conventional group, and the compatibility of USG with real-time, non-invasive, and cost-effective measurements. The paper acknowledges the limitations of the study, such as being a single-center trial and not examining other anatomical parameters that may influence DLT size selection. However, the study's results indicate that ultrasonography and computed tomography-guided measurement of cricoid cartilage diameter is a reliable and effective method compared to the conventional method for determining the size of a double-lumen tube in thoracic surgery.\nKey Points\nADVERTISEMENT\n- The study focused on the use of ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) to measure cricoid cartilage diameter for objective double-lumen tube (DLT) sizing in thoracic surgeries.\n- The research involved a randomized comparative trial of 120 adult patients undergoing thoracic surgery, categorized into USG, CT, and conventional DLT size determination based on height and gender, with the primary outcomes being appropriateness of DLT size, degree of lung collapse, and sore throat.\n- The article discussed the callenges of selecting the correct DLT size for thoracic surgeries, considering factors such as patient height, gender, tracheal diameter, left main bronchial (LMB) diameter, and cricoid cartilage transverse diameter.\n- Ultrasonography and computed tomography were explored as tools for accurately measuring the cricoid cartilage diameter, with advantages including quick, convenient, safe, and radiation-free assessment of airway anatomy. - The results showed improved accuracy of DLT sizing based on cricoid cartilage diameter, with significantly lower rates of inappropriate sizes and better outcomes in lung collapse and sore throat in the USG and CT groups compared to the conventional group.\n- The study acknowledged limitations such as being a single-center trial and not examining other anatomical parameters that may influence DLT size selection, but concluded that ultrasonography and computed tomography-guided measurement of cricoid cartilage diameter is a reliable and effective method for determining the size of a double-lumen tube in thoracic surgery.\nReference -\nMathew RM, Gautam S, Raman R, Rai A, Srivastava VK, Singh MK.

            "content": "The most effective injective treatment approach for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain remains unclear. Ruflli et al conducted a study to quantify the safety and effectiveness of the available injective strategies to address SIJ pain.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception until January 2023. Inclusion criteria were studies written in English, comparative and non-comparative studies regardless of the minimum follow-up, and case series on SIJ injections. Safety and efficacy of the different injection therapies for the SIJ were quantified. A meta-analysis was conducted on the available data of the documented injective therapies. The “Checklist for Measuring Quality” by Downs and Black was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of papers.\nAdvertisement\nThe key findings of the analysis:\n• The literature search retrieved 43 papers (2431 patients): 16 retrospective case series, 2 retrospective comparative studies, 17 prospective case series, 3 prospective comparative studies, and 5 randomized controlled trials.\n• The number of studies per year increased over time with 50% of the studies published since 2018.\n• Most of the studies were conducted in the USA including 51% of the patients, followed by Japan (9%), Egypt (9%), and Turkey (6%).\n• Of the selected studies, 63% examined the effect of steroid injections, 16% of PRP injections, while 21% reported other heterogeneous treatments.\n• The number of patients retrieved in the systematic review was 2431 (1237 women, 679 men, not reported in the remaining cases), 1425 with steroids, 306 treated with PRP, 700 with other treatments, while 3 studies did not specify the number of patients while only reporting the number of SIJ treated.\n• The mean age of patients treated with steroid injection was 50.4±15.7 years and the mean BMI was 30.2, the mean age of patients treated with PRP was 47.0±15.9 years and the mean BMI was 27.0.\n• The most common guidance used for injection was fluoroscopy (30 studies), followed by computer tomography (CT) (5 studies), ultrasound (4 studies), and anatomical landmarks (2 studies).\n• The failure rate was 26% in steroid injections and 14% in PRP injections.\n• The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in pain with the VAS score for both steroids and PRP: steroids improvement at mid-term 3.4 points (p < 0.05), at long-term 3.0 (p < 0.05), PRP improvement at mid-term 2.2 (p = 0.007), at long-term 2.3 points of the VAS pain scale (p = 0.02).\nThe authors concluded - “Steroids are the most documented injective approach, with studies showing an overall safety and effectiveness. Still, the high number of failures underlined by some studies suggest the need for alternative procedures. Early PRP data showed promise, but the limitations of the current literature do not allow to clearly define the most suitable injective approach, and further studies are needed to identify the best injective treatment for SIJ patients.”\nFurther reading:\nInjective Treatments for Sacroiliac Joint Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta analysis A.

            "content": "Liver resection is a challenging surgical procedure with inherent risks for both the anesthesiologist and the surgeon. Prof. Henrik Kehlet's concept of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) focuses on evidence-based strategies to minimize the physiological stress of surgery, resulting in quicker recovery, shorter hospital stays, and better postoperative results. Recent retrospective cohort study focuses on the compliance to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in liver resection and its correlation with patient outcomes. The study evaluates the compliance with 21 out of 25 ERAS recommendations for liver surgery and its association with the length of hospital stay (LOS) and the development of complications. The study included 44 hepatectomy patients and showed an overall compliance of 77%. Individual component compliance varied, with lower compliance rates in aspects such as fasting, carbohydrate loading, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and avoidance or early removal of the drain. The study divided the cohort into two groups based on their compliance with ERAS components. Group 1 had compliance to ≥75% of the elements, while group 2 had compliance to <75%. The results indicated that higher ERAS compliance was associated with reduced complications, although LOS differences were not statistically significant. Severe complications such as re‑exploration and death were noted in patients with compliance to fewer than 75% of the components. The paper stresses the potential clinical and financial benefits of increased ERAS compliance for patients undergoing liver resection surgery.\nAdvertisement\nERAS Principles and Global Application\nThe paper highlights the stress response associated with major abdominal surgery and the relevance of implementing evidence-based ERAS practices to reduce surgical stress, promote faster recovery times, and improve surgical outcomes. It emphasizes the global adoption of ERAS principles and the application of the concept to surgical specialties beyond colorectal surgeries. The study also discusses the variability in individual compliance rates with various ERAS components, with some components showing good compliance rates and others showing lower compliance rates.\nThe paper acknowledges the limitations of its retrospective design and relatively small sample size. It suggests the need for larger, preferably prospective, and randomized studies to further investigate the observations. Despite the limitations, the study demonstrates the potential for implementing ERAS protocols in liver surgery through institutional protocols and a multidisciplinary approach. It underscores the overall effectiveness of the ERAS protocol and encourages healthcare practitioners to closely follow it to benefit patients undergoing liver resection surgery.\nKey Points\n1.

            "content": "Tracheal extubation marks a crucial phase in transitioning the child to the post-anesthetic phase and is frequently accompanied by an elevated perioperative risk. Recent research paper titled \"A randomised controlled trial to compare tracheal extubation quality in lateral and supine positions after general anaesthesia in children\" published in J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacology aimed to compare the quality of tracheal extubation in lateral and supine positions in children undergoing elective surgeries under general anaesthesia.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPAUSE\nUNMUTE\nAdvertisement\nThe study found that positioning children in the lateral position during extubation resulted in improved extubation quality, as evidenced by lower cough scores with fewer incidents of complications compared to the supine position. The primary objective of the study was to compare tracheal extubation quality as judged by the Modified Minogue cough score, while the secondary objectives included assessment of the incidence of oxygen desaturation, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and upper airway obstruction during emergence from general anaesthesia. The study involved a single-blinded randomised trial with 110 children in the age group of 2–12 years enrolled to be positioned in either the lateral (group L) or supine (group S) position during extubation at the end of surgery.\nThe patients received a standardised anaesthesia regimen, and vital parameters, extubation quality, sedation score, and the incidence of adverse respiratory events were recorded every 5 minutes till 30 minutes post extubation. The findings revealed that children in the lateral position had a significantly lower cough score at the 15th minute post extubation compared to those in the supine position. Additionally, children in the lateral position had a lower incidence of adverse respiratory events (18%) compared to those in the supine position (30%) with a relative risk of 1.67. The study concluded that positioning children in the lateral position during extubation resulted in improved extubation quality.\nStudy Findings\nThe paper discussed various factors influencing tracheal extubation, such as the risks of respiratory complications, the lack of clear clinical protocols, and the decision-making process based on clinician experience. The study highlighted the importance of airway patency and the potential advantages of lateral positioning during extubation. It also recognized the need for further research on the impact of lateral positioning in different patient populations and identified limitations in blinding and the subjective nature of defining adverse events.\nDiscussion of Factors and Implications\nIn conclusion, the study provides valuable insights into the impact of lateral positioning on tracheal extubation quality in children, emphasizing the potential benefits of the lateral position in reducing respiratory complications and improving extubation outcomes. This detailed summary accurately conveys the main points and findings of the original research paper in 400 words.\nKey Points\n1.

            "content": "Postoperative pain is a common but undesirable outcome following surgery. It is crucial to effectively manage postoperative pain to facilitate proper recovery and minimize the negative effects of unmanaged pain. Recent prospective, observational study aimed to assess the use of nonpharmacological methods (NPMs) for postoperative pain management among patients following oncologic surgeries at a single center.\nAdvertisement\nThe primary objective was to determine the incidence of NPM use, while secondary objectives were to correlate NPM use with pain scores, patient satisfaction, and physical/emotional outcomes. The study included 200 adult patients who underwent major elective surgeries and were followed for the first 72 hours after surgery. Patients were interviewed on the third postoperative day to assess their use of NPMs, beliefs about NPMs, and responses to the American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ). The results showed that only 24.5% of the total study population used NPMs for postoperative pain relief. The most common NPMs used were prayer (11.5%), deep breathing (6%), and watching TV/reading (5-6%). When not in pain, 46% of patients reported using NPMs as part of their hospital routine, most commonly walking (23.5%), deep breathing (14%), and prayer (18.5%).\nAfter propensity matching patients based on surgery type and postoperative analgesia, there were no significant differences in pain scores, patient satisfaction, or physical/emotional outcomes between those who used NPMs and those who did not. Patients who did not use NPMs when in pain tended to spend less time (20% vs 30%) in severe pain compared to the NPM group, though this difference was not statistically significant.\nThe study found that education level impacted patients' beliefs and willingness to use NPMs, with more educated patients having a more positive view. However, overall, only 35% of patients believed in the benefits of NPMs for pain management, and 48% agreed to participate in NPMs after being informed of their potential usefulness. In conclusion, the use of NPMs for postoperative pain management was low in this patient population, with no clear benefits observed in pain scores, satisfaction, or outcomes. Lack of caregiver encouragement and low patient awareness about the benefits of NPMs appear to be key barriers. Improving education, particularly among less educated patients, may help increase the utilization of these complementary pain management techniques.\nKey Points\nHere are the 6 key points from the research paper:\n1. The study aimed to assess the use of nonpharmacological methods (NPMs) for postoperative pain management in patients following oncologic surgeries.\n2. The results showed that only 24.5% of the total study population used NPMs for postoperative pain relief, with the most common methods being prayer (11.5%), deep breathing (6%), and watching TV/reading (5-6%).\n3. When not in pain, 46% of patients reported using NPMs as part of their hospital routine, with the most common methods being walking (23.5%), deep breathing (14%), and prayer (18.5%).\n4. There were no significant differences in pain scores, patient satisfaction, or physical/emotional outcomes between those who used NPMs and those who did not, though patients who did not use NPMs when in pain tended to spend less time in severe pain.\n5. The study found that education level impacted patients' beliefs and willingness to use NPMs, with more educated patients having a more positive view, but overall, only 35% of patients believed in the benefits of NPMs for pain management.\n6. The low utilization of NPMs appears to be due to a lack of caregiver encouragement and low patient awareness about the benefits of these complementary pain management techniques, suggesting that improving education, particularly among less educated patients, may help increase their use.\nReference –\nBakshi SG, Arya K, Dhurwe B.

            "content": "India: A recent study has demonstrated that administering a low dose of nebulized dexamethasone before surgery can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat (POST) in patients undergoing general anaesthesia.\nThe research, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention, found that a 4 mg dose of dexamethasone was notably more effective than a placebo in mitigating POST, with no observed side effects. The study is scheduled for publication in the Oct-Dec 2024 issue of Apollo Medicine and is now available online ahead of its print release.\nAdvertisement\n\"Anaesthesia as a branch is a paradigm of various services offered under one roof. The main goal of an anesthetist is to make the patient feel most comfortable in an OT environment. This involves psychological management, physiological management, and pain management, all of which are done pharmacologically. Postoperative sore throat is one of the complications that occur in 21%-65% of anaesthetized persons,\" the lead author Dr. Arvinpreet Kaur, Department of Anaesthesia, Maharishi Markandeshwar Institute of Medical Science and Research (MMIMSR), Mullana, Haryana, India, told Medical Dialogues.\n\nDiscussing the study’s aim, she noted, “We aimed to utilize the most widely available medication in the smallest effective dose to alleviate sore throat symptoms. While various treatments have been explored, including lozenges, ketamine gargles, lignocaine jelly, and different forms of steroids, our focus was on dexamethasone. Administered at a dose of 4 mg via nebulization, dexamethasone is not only convenient for patients but also readily accessible for anesthetists in any setting, from remote clinics to major hospitals.”\nDr Kour and colleagues came together to conduct this study in the Anaesthesiology Department of Maharishi Markandeshwar Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (MMIMSR) Mullana, Ambala, after institutional ethical committee approval and written, with informed consent was secured from patients between March 2021 and March 2022, with Group S comprising 25 patients and Group D also consisting of 25 patients.\nGroup D: Patients were administered 4 mg of dexamethasone along with 4 mL of normal saline (totaling 5 mL) via a nebulization mask connected to a wall-mounted oxygen supply.\nGroup S: Patients were given 5 mL of normal saline nebulization (total volume 5 mL) through a nebulization mask, with the oxygen connected to the wall-mounted supply.\nStudy findings reveal:\n· 24 hours after extubation, none of the patients in Group D exhibited postoperative sore throat, whereas 8 patients (32%) in Group S experienced postoperative sore throat.\n· The occurrence of postoperative sore throat varied between the two groups, and the difference was statistically significant.\nTalking about the significance of this study, Dr. Kaur said “It would be so helpful and fruitful if more research is done using different doses and methods of administration of dexamethasone or various other modalities to prevent sore throat.”\nMentioning the mode of action of dexamethasone and normal saline, she added, “Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic glucocorticoid possessing anti-inflammatory effects. Various previous studies have used 8mg doses effectively for nebulisation which has decreased the incidence of sore throat postoperatively. In our study, we have used less dose which is 4mg for the same and luckily have not encountered any side effects. Normal saline on the other hand has been used as a placebo to make the study more effective and relevant.”\nReference: Parvez A, Gupta R, Kour A, Singh A.

            "content": "China: In a recent study, researchers evaluated the efficacy of azasetron in managing postoperative chronic pain following pulmonary surgery. The randomized triple-blind controlled trial, published recently in a leading medical journal, offers promising insights into enhancing pain management for patients undergoing major pulmonary procedures.\nThe study, published in BMC Anesthesiology, showed that azasetron had no impact on the occurrence of chronic pain following pulmonary surgery. The presence of preoperative pain, drinking, smoking, and open surgery were associated with chronic pain six months after surgery.\nAdvertisement\nChronic pain after pulmonary surgery remains a significant concern, impacting patients' quality of life and recovery. Traditional pain management strategies, including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), often fall short of providing adequate long-term relief and come with potential side effects. To address this issue, the study focused on azasetron, a novel compound known for its potential analgesic properties.\nXihong Ye, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Jinzhou Street, Xiangcheng District, Xiangyang, China, and colleagues tested the efficacy of azasetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on postoperative chronic pain following pulmonary surgery in a randomized triple-blind controlled study.\nThe study included 250 patients who were scheduled to receive pulmonary surgery. They were randomized to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) using 200 µg sufentanil with normal saline or 200 µg sufentanil with 20 mg azasetron.\nPain levels were measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS) at baseline and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3, as well as at 90 and 180 days. Negative binomial regression analysis was employed to identify factors influencing NRS scores six months post-surgery.\nThe following were the key findings:\nAzasetron did not affect the primary outcomes: the incidence of postoperative chronic pain on POD90 and 180.\nAzasetron decreased postoperative NRS at rest and activity on POD1, 2, and 3.\nAzasetron decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting on POD1 and 2.\nUnivariate and multivariate negative binomial regression analysis identified preoperative pain, smoking, drinking, and open surgery are risk factors for chronic pain six months after surgery.\n\"Our findings indicate that adding azasetron to PCA does not affect the incidence of postoperative chronic pain after pulmonary surgery. However, azasetron does significantly alleviate postoperative acute pain and reduces nausea and vomiting, suggesting it is a safe and effective adjunct for multimodal postoperative analgesia,\" the researchers wrote.\n\"Additionally, preoperative pain, smoking, alcohol consumption, and open surgery were identified as risk factors for postoperative chronic pain,\" they concluded.\nReference:\nXu, Y., Jiang, F., Shi, S. et al.

In a recent prospective randomized double-blind controlled trial, the study aimed to compare the effect of intravenous bolus and infusion of dexmedetomidine versus ketamine on postoperative analgesia in fracture femur patients operated under subarachnoid block. The study enrolled 75 patients aged 18–65 years, randomly divided into three groups to receive ketamine, dexmedetomidine, or saline (control group). Postoperative pain was evaluated using the numerical rating scale (NRS), duration of analgesia, and analgesic consumption.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPAUSE\nUNMUTE\nFULLSCREEN\nAdvertisement\nThe results showed that patients in the ketamine group had better postoperative analgesia with decreased pain on the NRS scale and reduced need for postoperative rescue analgesics. The duration of sensory block and motor block was prolonged in the ketamine group compared to the other two groups. The conclusion drawn from the study was that intraoperative use of intravenous ketamine was superior to dexmedetomidine for postoperative analgesia in fracture femur patients operated under subarachnoid block. The background of the study highlighted the limitations of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the importance of effective pain management for postoperative rehabilitation and quality of life. Multimodal analgesia was emphasized as the standard of care for postoperative pain management.\nThe study design involved enrolling patients aged 18–65 years with fractured femurs and subjected to subarachnoid block. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine were administered intraoperatively, and postoperative outcomes were assessed, including pain scores, duration of analgesia, rescue analgesic consumption, and complications. The results indicated that ketamine was more effective than dexmedetomidine in providing postoperative analgesia, as evidenced by lower NRS scores and reduced need for rescue analgesics. This is consistent with previous studies on the analgesic efficacy of ketamine, also showing its effectiveness in prolonging the duration of analgesia and providing better postoperative pain relief. However, both drugs were found to be effective in postoperative pain management.\nThe study also highlighted the safety and efficacy of ketamine in terms of sedation, as it resulted in a lower Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score compared to dexmedetomidine. The duration of sensory and motor block was also prolonged in the ketamine group, further emphasizing its effectiveness in postoperative pain management. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that intraoperative use of intravenous ketamine was superior to dexmedetomidine for postoperative analgesia in fracture femur patients operated under subarachnoid block. The findings suggest the potential benefit of using ketamine for pain management in orthopedic surgeries, particularly for femur fractures under spinal anesthesia.\nKey Points\n- A prospective randomized double-blind controlled trial compared the effects of intravenous bolus and infusion of dexmedetomidine versus ketamine on postoperative analgesia in femur fracture patients operated under subarachnoid block.\n- 75 patients aged 18–65 were randomly divided into three groups: ketamine, dexmedetomidine, and saline (control group).

            "content": "China: A recent randomized controlled trial has brought new insights into the use of perineural dexamethasone for managing nerve injury and recovery following surgery. The study, published in Heliyon, suggests that while dexamethasone is commonly used to reduce inflammation, its impact on nerve function recovery may be more complex than previously thought.\n\"Perineural dexamethasone could hinder nerve function recovery, indicating the need for caution, especially in patients with pre-existing nerve damage or diabetes,\" the researchers wrote.\nAdvertisement\nPerineural dexamethasone, a corticosteroid administered near nerves to alleviate inflammation and pain, is often used in surgical settings to enhance recovery and minimize postoperative discomfort. Although many studies have explored how perineural dexamethasone affects nerve block duration, its potential effects on postoperative nerve injury have not been thoroughly investigated. Considering this, Yunke Dai, Department of Anesthesiology, Clinical Medical College and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and colleagues aimed to clarify the impact of perineural dexamethasone on nerve injury and the recovery of nerve function following surgery.\nThe study, a prospective randomized double-blinded trial, was conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College in Chengdu, China, from June 14 to December 30, 2022. It involved patients aged 18 to 80 years, classified as ASA I or II, who were scheduled for elective orthopedic, burn, or plastic surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either perineural dexamethasone (D group) or no dexamethasone (ND group).\nThe primary outcomes measured were the incidence and recovery of nerve injury, while secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, analgesic consumption, and adverse events.\nThe researchers reported the following findings:\nInitial postoperative nerve injury rates were similar between groups (D: 30.4 %, ND: 33.3 %).\nAt 12 weeks post-discharge, significantly more patients in the ND group recovered from nerve deficits (78.8 % versus 60.3 %; OR = 2.45).\nThere were no significant differences in postoperative hyperglycemia or surgical site infection rates.\nThe study revealed that perineural dexamethasone did not increase the initial risk of postoperative nerve injury but seemed to delay recovery from nerve injury symptoms. The researchers suggest weighing the advantages of prolonged analgesia and reduced postoperative nausea against this potential delay. Diabetes and tourniquet use were identified as significant risk factors, necessitating extra caution in these patients.\n\"These findings underscore the need for careful use of dexamethasone in high-risk individuals. Future research should focus on optimizing dosing, exploring alternative administration methods, and conducting longer-term studies to better understand the impact of dexamethasone on nerve recovery,\" the researchers concluded.\nReference:\nZhu, N., Xiang, B., Shi, J., Yang, P., Dai, Y., & Wang, S.

            "content": "Emergence agitation (EA) refers to the manifestation of aggressive psychomotor symptoms during the emergence from general anesthesia, and it can lead to harm for both the patient and medical staff. It is commonly observed following nasal surgeries, and postoperative pain is considered a significant factor contributing to this condition. Therefore, effective pain management plays a crucial role in preventing EA in such surgical procedures. The use of preemptive analgesia through peripheral nerve blocks in conjunction with general anesthesia offers the benefit of maintaining a stable hemodynamic profile, promoting good recovery quality, and reducing the need for both intra- and postoperative analgesics. The maxillary nerve (MN) is a purely sensory nerve responsible for transmitting sensation from various facial structures, such as the nasal cavity, nose, palate, dental arch, cheek, lip, sinus, and eyelid. Consequently, blocking this nerve can effectively provide pain relief for diverse procedures, including septoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nRecent research paper evaluated the effectiveness of a suprazygomatic maxillary nerve (MN) block guided by ultrasound (US) in reducing emergence agitation (EA) and improving postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing septorhinoplasty. The study was a prospective randomized trial that compared outcomes between a group that received the nerve block (SMB group) and a control group that did not. The key findings were: 1. Incidence of EA was significantly lower in the SMB group (16.7%) compared to the control group (46.6%, p=0.026). 2. Pain scores at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postoperatively were significantly decreased in the SMB group compared to the control group (p=0.024, 0.000, 0.000, 0.009, and 0.038 respectively). 3. Total 24-hour postoperative morphine consumption was significantly less in the SMB group compared to the control group (p=0.000). 4. Intraoperative consumption of fentanyl and isoflurane was also significantly reduced in the SMB group compared to the control group (p=0.000 and p=0.001 respectively). The researchers concluded that preemptive application of US-guided suprazygomatic MN block was effective in lowering the incidence of EA and enhancing postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty. The regional nerve block reduced the requirement for intraoperative anesthetic agents and postoperative rescue analgesics. No serious adverse events were reported. Overall, the findings suggest that the MN block is a valuable technique for improving postoperative outcomes in this patient population.\nKey Points\nHere are the 6 key points from the research paper:\n1. The study evaluated the effectiveness of a suprazygomatic maxillary nerve (MN) block guided by ultrasound (US) in reducing emergence agitation (EA) and improving postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing septorhinoplasty.\n2. The incidence of EA was significantly lower in the SMB group (16.7%) compared to the control group (46.6%, p=0.026).\n3. Pain scores at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postoperatively were significantly decreased in the SMB group compared to the control group.\n4. Total 24-hour postoperative morphine consumption was significantly less in the SMB group compared to the control group (p=0.000).\n5. Intraoperative consumption of fentanyl and isoflurane was also significantly reduced in the SMB group compared to the control group.\n6. The researchers concluded that preemptive application of US-guided suprazygomatic MN block was effective in lowering the incidence of EA and enhancing postoperative analgesia, and reduced the requirement for intraoperative anesthetic agents and postoperative rescue analgesics, with no serious adverse events reported.\nReference –\nAfandy ME, Abd Elghafar MS, Shoukr TG, El Mourad MB.

            "content": "Cancer patients who have had Covid-19 may experience unfavorable outcomes after cancer surgery due to specific risk factors such as immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and increased susceptibility to infection and malnutrition. Recent research paper is a prospective, comparative study conducted to examine the impact of Covid-19 infection history on postoperative morbidity and mortality in cancer patients undergoing elective surgery. The study aimed to compare the outcomes in post-Covid-19 (PC) and non-Covid-19 (NC) groups and explore the implications for surgical risk. A total of 414 patients were included, with 109 experiencing postoperative complications, and the study found that the PC group had a higher incidence of complications, particularly pulmonary complications, compared to the NC group. The overall mortality rate was 0.72%. The study also investigated the impact of different intervals between Covid-19 diagnosis and surgery and revealed a higher incidence of respiratory complications within 2-4 weeks after Covid-19 diagnosis, decreasing over time. Additionally, the study examined various factors associated with postoperative complications, such as age, hypothyroidism, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), providing insights into risk stratification for surgical outcomes\nAdvertisement\nMorbidity Risk Profile and Waiting Period Recommendations\nThe study employed the Portsmouth-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (P-POSSUM) score to estimate morbidity and mortality risk, and it was observed that PC and NC groups had a comparable morbidity risk profile. The findings indicated that cancer patients with a history of Covid infection are at a higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, suggesting the need for a minimum holding period before surgery for asymptomatic patients and a longer waiting period for symptomatic patients. This recommendation aligns with updated guidelines advising a 7-8 week waiting period for elective surgeries after Covid-19 infection. It was also noted that older age, hypothyroidism, and low PNI were associated with a higher incidence of complications, providing valuable insights for preoperative risk assessment and patient counseling.\nEnhancing Surgical Outcomes for Covid-19-Recovered Cancer Patients\nOverall, the study contributes to the understanding of the impact of Covid-19 infection on postoperative outcomes in cancer patients undergoing elective surgery. The findings underscore the importance of risk stratification, proper prehabilitation, and postoperative care to improve perioperative outcomes for Covid-19-recovered cancer patients. The study's recommendations suggest a practical approach to optimize surgical outcomes in this patient population and provide valuable insights for future decision-making regarding the timing of elective surgeries for patients with a history of Covid-19 infection.\nKey Points\n1.

The study was conducted from 2020 to 2021 in Caen University Hospital, France. The protocol included a bolus dose of 1.5 mg kg−1, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg kg−1 h‑1 until the beginning of hepatic transection. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine were measured four times during and after the lidocaine infusion.\nAdvertisement\nThe study included 20 subjects who underwent liver resection, with 35% having preexisting liver disease before tumor diagnosis, and 75% undergoing major hepatectomy. The plasmatic levels of lidocaine were within the therapeutic range, and no blood sample showed a concentration above the toxicity threshold throughout the infusion. Comparative analysis between the presence of preexisting liver disease or not and the association of intraoperative vascular clamping did not show significant differences concerning lidocaine blood levels.\nThe findings suggested that perioperative lidocaine infusion is safe in the field of liver surgery, and it was concluded that additional prospective studies are needed to assess the clinical usefulness in terms of analgesia and antitumoral effects. The study also highlighted the potential implications of intravenous lidocaine in liver surgery, mentioning its analgesic effects in the context of enhanced recovery after surgery. The paper discussed the metabolism of lidocaine in the liver, the recommended lidocaine infusion protocol, and the therapeutic range of lidocaine levels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe study found that the intravenous lidocaine infusion used in the protocol maintained effective concentrations until surgical closure, and no adverse events related to lidocaine infusion were reported. Additionally, the study explored the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine during liver surgery, emphasizing the safety and tolerability of the lidocaine dosage used in the study. The limitations of the study, such as the small sample size and early termination of lidocaine infusion, were also noted, and it was suggested that further studies are necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine in liver surgery.\nIn conclusion, the pilot study demonstrated the safety of intravenous lidocaine in the context of liver surgery and suggested further studies to evaluate its efficacy on postoperative pain.

            "content": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is extensively utilized in cardiac surgery to provide real-time, high-resolution images of the heart and its surrounding structures, contributing significantly to surgical decision-making, procedural monitoring, and postoperative outcome assessment. Recent study investigated factors predictive of difficult transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe insertion in adult cardiac surgery patients. The observational study involved 119 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, analyzing demographic variables (age, gender, BMI) and airway factors (modified Mallampati classification, modified Cormack-Lehane grading, and thyromental distance). The difficulty of TEE probe insertion was categorized into three grades, and various maneuvers were assessed for difficult insertions.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nResults and Key Findings\nResults showed that 30.3% of insertions were difficult, and male gender, BMI ≥30 kg/m2, Mallampati class III-IV, Cormack-Lehane grade IIb-IV, and thyromental distance <6.5 cm were significantly associated with difficult insertion. Jaw thrust was the most effective maneuver for difficult cases, used in 58.3% of instances. The study highlighted the potential complications associated with difficult TEE probe insertion, such as oropharyngeal injuries and esophageal perforation, particularly with larger 3D TEE probes. The findings emphasized the importance of identifying predictive factors to anticipate challenges and reduce complications.\nPatient Characteristics and Airway Factors\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe study involved ethical approval and excluded patients with contraindications to TEE probe placement. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 75 years, with a higher proportion of males. The BMI distribution showed a significant portion of overweight and obese patients. Airway characteristics, including Mallampati scores and Cormack-Lehane grading, indicated potential difficulties with TEE probe insertion. While the majority of insertions were performed without difficulty, 30.3% required intervention, with jaw thrust being the most commonly used and effective technique.\nStatistical Associations\nThe study found statistical associations between demographic and airway factors and difficult TEE probe insertion, with Mallampati class III-IV showing the strongest association. Men, individuals with high BMI, and unfavorable airway characteristics were also significantly associated with difficulty. The use of video laryngoscopy was not required in any case, suggesting that simpler techniques were sufficient. The study provided valuable insights into the predictive factors associated with difficult TEE probe insertion, highlighting the importance of comprehensive preoperative airway assessment and the value of simple, effective maneuvers in managing insertion difficulties. The findings emphasized the need for further research to validate the results in larger, multi-center studies and explore additional predictive tools to enhance patient safety during TEE probe insertion.\nKey Points\n- The study aimed to identify factors predictive of difficult transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe insertion in adult cardiac surgery patients.

The study aimed to test whether intermittent IV paracetamol administration would result in a reduction of at least 30% of the median weight-adjusted cumulative morphine dose during the first 48 hours after cardiac surgery.\nAdvertisement\nThe study found that intermittent IV paracetamol significantly reduced the median weight-adjusted cumulative morphine consumption in the first 48 hours postoperative by 79% compared to continuous morphine. The study, conducted between March 2016 and July 2020, included 208 children aged 0–3 years undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. It found that 102 patients received intermittent IV paracetamol, while 106 received continuous morphine. Additionally, the study showed that the rescue morphine consumption was similar between the two groups. The analysis also demonstrated non-inferiority of IV paracetamol administration in terms of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores.\nThe authors concluded that in children aged 0–3 years undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of intermittent IV paracetamol reduces the median weight-adjusted cumulative morphine consumption in the first 48 hours after surgery by 79%. The study implications suggest that intermittent IV paracetamol as the primary analgesic could be an effective approach for postoperative pain management in this patient population, potentially leading to reduced morphine consumption and equal pain relief.\nOverall, the research paper provides evidence for the potential benefits of using intermittent IV paracetamol as a primary analgesic to reduce morphine consumption in young children after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The findings have implications for clinical practice in managing postoperative pain in this specific patient population.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe study was approved by the relevant medical ethics committees and registered in clinical trial registries. The data used in the study are available, and the study was funded by relevant health research and development organizations. The authors declared no competing interests in the study.\nThe paper provides detailed insights into the methodology, patient characteristics, outcomes, statistical analysis, and implications of the study. The findings have significant implications for postoperative pain management in young children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.\nKey Points\n1.

            "content": "Nearly 100 wildfires are currently raging throughout the country, burning more than 2 million acres. The rising frequency of these fires poses a special concern for anesthesiologists – the potential for increased rates of adverse outcomes from anesthesia and surgery among patients exposed to wildfire smoke, according to a special article in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the peer-reviewed journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA).\nAdvertisement\n\"Wildfire smoke causes inflammation and is known to worsen heart and lung disease and pregnancy outcomes,\" said senior author Vijay Krishnamoorthy, M.D., M.P.H., Ph. D., chief of the Critical Care Medicine Division and associate professor of anesthesiology and population health sciences at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. \"At a time of rising global exposure, anesthesiologists need to be equipped to manage the potential adverse effects of wildfire smoke exposure on perioperative outcomes.\"\nOver the past two decades, about 60% of countries have experienced increased wildfires and smoke exposure. Wildfire smoke contains a complex mix of fine particles and chemicals producing inflammation and oxidative stress (low antioxidant levels). Once inhaled, particles enter the circulatory system and can damage the heart, lungs and other organs.\nInhaled particles can also injure the lining of blood vessels (endothelium), as well as activate platelets and inflammatory cells and clotting abnormalities in small blood vessels. Exposure to fine-particle air pollution has documented effects on cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, heart rhythm abnormalities, heart failure, and stroke.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAll these factors lead to increased rates of underlying health conditions (comorbidity) among patients undergoing surgery. A previous study in Anesthesiology reported that, among young children with asthma-like symptoms, risk for adverse respiratory events under anesthesia are increased during periods of poor air quality due to wildfire smoke.\n\"Wildfire smoke poses significant health risks, particularly in people with pre-existing heart and lung disease, obese patients, infants and young children, and other vulnerable groups,\" said Dr. Krishnamoorthy. \"We hope our paper will inform anesthesia clinicians about the potential impact of wildfire smoke on patient outcomes, and the urgent need for information and action to better understand and manage these risks.\"\nIn general, little is known about how wildfire smoke negatively affects the risks of anesthesia and surgery. Key knowledge gaps include a lack of information on the broader impacts on patient outcomes – which might be addressed by linking geographic smoke exposure data to databases that include surgical outcomes. Dr. Krishnamoorthy's research group is developing a mathematical model to better understand the effects of exposure to high levels of particulate pollutants.\nThis and other lines of research may enable anesthesiologists to develop guidelines for assessing and managing the risks to patients scheduled for surgery who have been exposed to wildfire smoke. For example, adjusting the timing of surgery based on predicted levels of wildfire smoke exposure might provide a way to improve outcomes and reduce complications in patients at risk.\nReference:\nFintan Hughes, Luke Parsons, Jerrold H.

Recent study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and duration of peripheral nerve block versus local surgical site anesthetic infiltration for pain relief in patients undergoing elective hand and wrist surgery. The study was conducted at the Orthopedic Department of the Duhok Emergency Teaching Hospital in Iraq, including 300 patients aged 18-75 years who underwent various elective hand and wrist procedures.\nAdvertisement\nThe patients were randomly divided into three groups, each receiving a different pain relief method. The degree and duration of pain relief were assessed using standardized pain assessment tools.\nThe authors conclude that ultrasound-guided nerve block is superior for achieving longer duration of pain relief compared to the other methods. However, local surgical site infiltration was more effective at reducing the severity of postoperative pain.\nThe study is limited by the use of only one type of local anesthetic and the relatively small sample size. The authors recommend further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to better understand the most appropriate pain management approach for elective hand and wrist surgeries.\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of different regional anesthesia techniques for pain control following hand and wrist procedures, highlighting the trade-offs between duration and intensity of pain relief.\nKey Points -\nBased on the provided research paper summary, the 3 key points are:\n1.

            "content": "Multiple techniques are used to manage postoperative pain in patients who have undergone scrotal surgeries, with one such approach being the ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block (US-SCB). In order to improve the quality of anesthesia and prolong postoperative pain relief, various agents have been combined with local agents. Recent study aimed to assess the effects of combining neostigmine with levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block (US-SCB) for providing perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing testicular sperm extraction (TESE) surgery. The double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 112 subjects who were divided into two groups. One group received neostigmine and levobupivacaine in the US-SCB, while the other group received levobupivacaine alone. The primary outcomes measured were the duration of postoperative analgesia and the amount of analgesic consumed in the first 24 hours. The results showed that the group receiving the neostigmine and levobupivacaine combination had a significantly increased mean postoperative analgesia duration and reduced total analgesic consumption compared to the group receiving levobupivacaine alone. Additionally, the study found no significant differences in complications between the two groups.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nStudy Conclusion and Background Information\nThe study concluded that adding neostigmine to the local anesthetic solution in US-SCB delayed the first analgesic request postoperatively and reduced perioperative analgesia consumption without significant side effects. The study also discussed the background and aims, providing details about the TESE procedure and the various anesthesia options available, including local, spinal, and general anesthesia. The authors noted that while general anesthesia can control patient anxiety, it does not eliminate postoperative pain sensation, which can be managed with oral analgesics, parenteral opioids, and neuraxial or regional analgesia techniques. The paper discussed the benefits and limitations of using the spermatic cord block, as well as the importance of adding adjuvants to prolong the block's postoperative duration and reduce the local anesthetic dose.\nStudy Methodology and Comparison with Previous Research\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe paper also provided a detailed description of the study methodology, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization process, and anesthesia and surgical procedures. The findings of the study were compared with previous research on the use of neostigmine as an adjuvant to local agents in other regional anesthesia techniques, noting both supportive and conflicting evidence. The study acknowledged some limitations, including the small sample size and the need for further research to test different doses of the agents and assess the sensorial blocked area. Overall, the study suggests that adding neostigmine to a local anesthetic solution in spermatic cord block can be a promising choice to prolong the time for the first analgesic requirement postoperatively and reduce perioperative analgesia consumption without significant side effects.\nKey Points\n- The study aimed to evaluate the effects of combining neostigmine with levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block (US-SCB) for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing testicular sperm extraction (TESE) surgery.\n- A double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 112 subjects showed that the group receiving neostigmine and levobupivacaine in the US-SCB had significantly increased mean postoperative analgesia duration and reduced total analgesic consumption compared to the group receiving levobupivacaine alone.\n- The study concluded that adding neostigmine to the local anesthetic solution in US-SCB delayed the first analgesic request postoperatively and reduced perioperative analgesia consumption without significant side effects.\n- Background information about the TESE procedure and anesthesia options, including local, spinal, and general anesthesia, was provided.

            "content": "Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are utilized for airway maintenance during anesthesia procedures. Recent study aimed to investigate the impact of operating table height on supraglottic airway device (SAD) insertion and task performance. The researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial with 90 patients to determine the appropriate table height during SAD insertion in terms of time taken for insertion, success rate, ease of insertion, and anesthesiologist comfort. The patients were divided into three groups, and the table height was adjusted so that the patient’s forehead was at the level of 5 cm above the xiphoid process in group I, at the level of the xiphoid process in group II, and at the level of 5 cm below the xiphoid process in group III of the anesthesiologist. The study measured SAD insertion time, first attempt success rate, ease of insertion, and anesthesiologist comfort during the procedure.\nAdvertisement\nResults and Conclusion\nThe results revealed that the SAD insertion time was lower in group III than in groups I and II, and a significant difference was found between the groups. Additionally, the mean ease of insertion score, anesthesiologist comfort, and the first-attempt success rate of SAD insertion were higher in group III than in groups I and II, with statistically significant differences. The study concluded that the lower table height with the patient’s forehead at the level of 5 cm below the xiphoid process of the anesthesiologist is ergonomically more efficient during SAD insertion and also more comfortable for the anesthesiologist. The study highlighted the importance of proper positioning of the patient’s head and the level of the patient in relation to the anesthesiologist, as improper positioning can lead to physical problems such as cervical disc pain, mental workload, and poor task performance.\nThe study utilized a randomized controlled trial design and was conducted from August 2021 to January 2022. The trial involved ASA physical status I and II patients, aged between 18 and 60 years, with mallampati of grade I and II. The primary outcome of the study was the SAD insertion time, which was significantly lower in group III than in groups I and II. The secondary outcomes, including the first-attempt success rate, ease of insertion, and anesthesiologist comfort, were also higher in group III than in group I and group II, with statistically significant differences among the groups. The study also mentioned the importance of appropriate operating table height in relation to the anesthesiologist during SAD insertion and the potential impact on the comfort and efficiency of the procedure.\nKey Points\n- A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the impact of operating table height on supraglottic airway device (SAD) insertion and task performance in 90 patients.\n- The patients were divided into three groups, where the table height was adjusted to position the patient’s forehead at different levels in relation to the anesthesiologist's xiphoid process. - The study measured SAD insertion time, first attempt success rate, ease of insertion, and anesthesiologist comfort during the procedure.\n- Results showed that the SAD insertion time was lower, ease of insertion score was higher, anesthesiologist comfort was improved, and the first-attempt success rate of SAD insertion was higher when the table height positioned the patient’s forehead at the level of 5 cm below the xiphoid process of the anesthesiologist.\n- The study concluded that lower table height with the patient’s forehead at the level of 5 cm below the xiphoid process of the anesthesiologist is ergonomically more efficient during SAD insertion and also more comfortable for the anesthesiologist.\n- The study utilized a randomized controlled trial design and highlighted the importance of proper positioning of the patient’s head and level of the patient in relation to the anesthesiologist during SAD insertion, as improper positioning can lead to physical problems and poor task performance.\nReference –\nKumari P, Kumar A, Sinha C, Kumar A.

            "content": "Recently published paper explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic pain in patients. The study, conducted on 150 patients with chronic pain conditions for more than three months, revealed that the pandemic had significant effects on the physical and mental well-being of the patients. Majority of the patients were females, with the mean age of 50 ± 13 years, and the most common sites of pain being low back, knee, and neck. The pandemic led to a significant increase in the intensity and frequency of pain, which also affected sleep, working capacity, and mental health of the individuals. It was observed that more than half of the interventional pain procedures were delayed due to the fear of contracting infection, leading to decreased follow-up in the outpatient department.\nAdvertisement\nFindings and discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on chronic pain patients\nThe findings revealed that chronic pain patients developed coping strategies to manage the pain, and those with comorbidities were the hardest hit. Additionally, the pandemic adversely affected sleep, daily activities, working capacity, and emotional/mental health in individuals with chronic pain. The study also highlighted the association of COVID-19 with myalgias, referred pain, and widespread hyperalgesia, leading to worsening of chronic pain due to exacerbation of preexisting conditions. The paper discussed the impact of COVID-19 on the health of chronic pain patients, in particular, the effects on pain frequency, intensity, and quality, along with the challenges in accessing medical care, including delays in interventional pain procedures and follow-up appointments.\nRecommendations and conclusion for chronic pain management during a pandemic\nThe study emphasized the urgent need to develop training programs for healthcare providers and patients to ensure uninterrupted and safe treatment services for chronic pain patients during a pandemic. The pandemic also brought to light the importance of utilizing digital resources and widening the spectrum of management and coping strategies for chronic pain patients. The paper concluded that it is imperative to ensure continuous treatment for chronic pain patients during and after a pandemic, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies to address the challenges faced by chronic pain patients during such health crises. The study acknowledges some limitations, such as being a single-centric, subjective, and questionnaire-based study, and calls for further epidemiologic studies to focus on chronic pain management in the post-pandemic era.\nKey Points\n1. Impact of COVID-19 on Chronic Pain Management: The study focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic pain management in 150 patients with chronic pain conditions lasting more than three months. It was found that the pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the intensity and frequency of pain, leading to adverse effects on sleep, working capacity, and mental health of the individuals. The fear of contracting infection led to delays in interventional pain procedures and decreased follow-up in the outpatient department.\n2. Effects on Chronic Pain Patients: The findings highlighted that chronic pain patients developed coping strategies to manage their pain during the pandemic, with those having comorbidities being the most affected. The pandemic also adversely affected sleep, daily activities, working capacity, and emotional/mental health. The study discussed the association of COVID-19 with myalgias, referred pain, and widespread hyperalgesia, which exacerbated preexisting chronic pain conditions.\n3. Impact of COVID-19 on Health of Chronic Pain Patients: The paper discussed the impact of the pandemic on the health of chronic pain patients, specifically focusing on pain frequency, intensity, and quality. It also highlighted the challenges in accessing medical care, including delays in interventional pain procedures and follow-up appointments, which further worsened the condition of chronic pain patients.\n4. Recommendations for Chronic Pain Management During a Pandemic: The study emphasized the urgent need to develop training programs for healthcare providers and patients to ensure uninterrupted and safe treatment services for chronic pain patients during a pandemic. It also stressed the importance of utilizing digital resources and widening the spectrum of management and coping strategies for chronic pain patients, both during and after a pandemic.\n5. Conclusion and Implications: The paper concluded that it is essential to ensure continuous treatment for chronic pain patients during and after a pandemic, and comprehensive strategies are needed to address the challenges faced by chronic pain patients during health crises. The study acknowledged its limitations, such as being a single-centric, subjective, and questionnaire-based study, and called for further epidemiologic studies in the post-pandemic era.\n6. Key Findings: Overall, the study highlighted the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic pain management, focusing on the physical and mental well-being of patients, the challenges in accessing medical care, and the importance of developing comprehensive strategies to address the needs of chronic pain patients during and after a pandemic.\nReference –\nMalhotra N, Charan N, Budhwar D, Kumar A, Sinha N,Phogat V.

            "content": "In a rigorous medical records study covering tens of thousands of patients, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers conclude that some patients with preoperative anemia have better outcomes if they get iron infusions before surgery rather than standard red blood cell transfusions.\nThe findings, published in Anesthesia & Analgesia, contribute to mounting evidence that such iron infusions, which boost the production of a person’s own red blood cells, are better than relying on someone else’s blood.\nAdvertisement\n“Anemia is incredibly common, especially in surgical patients, and until recently the default treatment has been blood transfusions prior to the procedure,” says Steven Frank, M.D., professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “However, our retrospective study showed a benefit of iron infusions over preoperative blood transfusions in decreasing morbidity and mortality, increasing hemoglobin and decreasing the need for blood transfusions.”\nIron is a mineral that the human body needs to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to organs throughout the body. If there is insufficient iron in a patient’s blood, the person becomes anemic, meaning there are not enough healthy red blood cells to deliver enough oxygen. This is particularly concerning for patients undergoing surgery because there is almost always some amount of blood loss during any procedure.\nWhile blood transfusions work, they also carry risks, including blood clots, hospital-acquired infections, allergic reactions and pulmonary complications. It can be difficult to find a donor match if a patient has certain antibodies or a condition such as sickle cell disease. As a result, physicians have long sought strategies to minimize the use of transfusions.\nIn the new study, the Johns Hopkins Medicine research team used data from the TriNetX Research Network database, a global network of health care organizations that pool de-identified patient information. The team’s analysis used such information gathered between 2003 and 2023 on 154,358 patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis of iron-deficient anemia prior to surgery.\nThe data were sorted into groups of patients who were treated with iron preoperatively but not with a blood transfusion, and patients who received a preoperative blood transfusion but no iron infusion. These infusions happened several weeks before a scheduled surgical procedure. Researchers then compared postoperative complication rates including respiratory problems, kidney issues, blood clots, infections and death rates.\nFrom this review, researchers found a 37% reduction in mortality and a 24% reduction in morbidity (complications) in patients who were treated with iron infusions compared with those treated with blood transfusions. This finding means that patients receiving iron infusions may recover more quickly and fully from their surgical procedures without any added complications that may arise from a blood transfusion.\n“The Joint Commission and the American Medical Association named blood transfusion as the No. 1 overused procedure in 2012. For perspective, also on the list was antibiotic use to treat the common cold,” says Frank. “Research shows reducing blood transfusions can improve patient outcomes, and providing patients with preoperative iron infusions is an easy way to do so.”\nThe researchers say they hope the new study will encourage more widespread use of preoperative iron infusions in surgical patients. They also hope to examine if oral iron supplements garner the same outcomes as infusions.\nTreating preoperative anemia is one of several methods used in a comprehensive patient blood management program. Such a program, like the one at Johns Hopkins, can save blood and money while resulting in the same or better patient outcomes. In another recent publication, the researchers reported a substantial return on investment for their blood management program. They found that for every dollar spent to support the program, 7.5 dollars were saved or generated in return.\nSimple things, like keeping patients warm and maintaining a lower blood pressure during surgery, or giving medications such as tranexamic acid, can reduce bleeding. “In addition to treating preoperative anemia,” Frank says, “keeping the blood in the patient during surgery is one of the primary goals in any patient blood management program.” Such programs, by reducing unnecessary transfusions, promote high-value practice by improving outcomes and reducing costs.\nReference:\nChoi, Una E.

            "content": "A new study published in the journal of Anaesthesia found that patients having parathyroid and thyroid surgery underwent less postoperative vomiting and nausea when under opioid-free propofol anesthesia. The use of opioids for perioperative analgesia is common. Also, the postoperative hyperalgesia and increased analgesic consumption may be linked to the intraoperative administration of high bolus doses or continuous infusions of powerful opioids. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), extended sedation, ileus, and urine retention are examples of opioid-related side effects that might postpone the recovery and release or result in an unplanned return to the hospital. After thyroid and parathyroid surgery, postoperative nausea and vomiting are common and are linked to poorer patient outcomes. Thereby, Dan Wang and colleagues undertook this study to analyze if opioid-free propofol anesthesia would be less likely to cause postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients having who have undergone these operations when compared to opioid-inclusive propofol anesthesia.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nAt two medical facilities in mainland China, this research enrolled adult patients slated for thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. The patients were randomized 1:1, stratified by study location and sex, to either the opioid-inclusive group (sufentanil and propofol) or the opioid-free group (esketamine, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine, and propofol). Bispectral index 45 to 55 was reached by titrating propofol infusions and the patients were given multimodal analgesia with paracetamol and flurbiprofen axetil as well as prophylactic treatment for nausea and vomiting with dexamethasone and ondansetron. The prevalence of postoperative vomiting and nausea in the first 48 hours following surgery was the main result.\nOut of the total 557 people nearly 394 individuals were deemed eligible for this study. The opioid-free anesthesia group (10/197, 5%) had a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the first 48 hours after surgery than the opioid-inclusive group (47/197, 24%). Furthermore, fewer instances of hypotension and desaturation following tracheal extubation, as well as greater patient satisfaction, were associated with opioid-free propofol anesthesia.\nThe opioid-free group faced a small delay in the time to tracheal extubation. The 30-day results and postoperative pain ratings for the two groups were comparable. Overall, the findings of this study found that the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting following thyroid and parathyroid operations was much lower when propofol anesthesia was opioid-free. Despite somewhat delayed tracheal extubation, the opioid-free regimen also resulted in lower rates of hypotension and desaturation, fewer rescue anti-emetics and increased patient satisfaction.\nSource:\nWang, D., Sun, Y., Zhu, Y., Shan, X., Liu, H., Ji, F., & Peng, K.

            "content": "China: A recent study has shown the effectiveness of dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) in controlling pain associated with total myomectomy, has less impact on patients' sleep, and reduces the negative impact of stress factors, leading to fewer adverse effects. The findings were published online in the World Journal of Clinical Cases.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPAUSE\nUterine fibroids are frequently occurring benign gynecological conditions. Treatment typically involves medication for patients experiencing excessive menstruation, anemia, and pressure symptoms. In severe cases, a total hysterectomy may be necessary, although this procedure is invasive and can lead to significant postoperative pain. This discomfort may impact the patient's sleep quality after surgery, affecting the overall recovery process.\nAdvertisement\nPatient-controlled epidural analgesia is a widely used method for self-administered pain relief, typically employing low concentrations of opioid analgesics. Morphine is currently the predominant choice due to its effective pain management capabilities. However, it can induce side effects such as nausea and vomiting, especially in patients undergoing total hysterectomy, possibly due to hormonal and endocrine factors. Dezocine, a phenylmorphanolane derivative, exhibits analgesic effects that correlate closely with dosage. Comparative studies evaluating equivalent analgesic doses of sufentanil, fentanyl, and dezocine have demonstrated that dezocine offers a better safety profile with less impact on consciousness levels and fewer adverse reactions.\nAgainst the above background, Feng-Feng Ning, Department of Anesthesiology, Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child-care Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China, and colleagues aimed to evaluate dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia use for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing total myomectomy.\nFor this purpose, they selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. They randomized them into two groups; a control group received 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine, and an observation group received 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes evaluated included pain levels, recovery indices, sedation, stress factors, PCEA usage, and sleep quality.\nAdvertisement\nThe following were the key findings of the study:\nThe observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol, and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters than the control group.\nThe cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group.\nThe researchers conclude, \"We explored the effectiveness of dezocine PCEA in pain management following total hysterectomy. Initial findings suggest that dezocine PCEA effectively alleviates post-procedural pain, mitigates the impact of stress factors, enhances sleep quality among patients, and reduces the incidence of adverse reactions. These outcomes offer significant implications for clinical anesthesia practices.\"\nReference:\nNing, Feng-Feng, et al. \"Application of Dezocine Patient-controlled Epidural Analgesia in Postoperative Analgesia in Patients With Total Myomectomy.\" World Journal of Clinical Cases, vol. 12, no. 20, 2024, pp. 4265-4271.",

            "content": "Spinal anesthesia is now the preferred technique for cesarean section because it has a rapid onset and poses considerably reduced anesthetic risks for both the mother and the fetus. Recent study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ondansetron in preventing maternal hypotension during spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine for cesarean sections. A total of 138 primigravida parturients were randomly assigned to three groups: one received 4 mg of ondansetron, another received 8 mg of ondansetron, and the control group received normal saline. Noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, doses of phenylephrine or ephedrine, and various other parameters were recorded.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study concluded that there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of blood pressure, heart rate, doses of phenylephrine or ephedrine, time for the block, incidence of nausea/vomiting, umbilical artery pH, and neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, showing that ondansetron did not have a significant effect in preventing maternal hypotension following spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine for cesarean section. The paper highlighted that spinal anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean sections due to its fast onset and lower anesthetic risks. However, the sudden decrease in afterload following lumbar sympathetic blockade may cause hypotension and fetal compromise. Ondansetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, was suggested as a potential preventative measure for spinal-induced hypotension. Although previous studies have shown some beneficial effects of ondansetron, particularly when used with bupivacaine, the current study specifically focused on its interaction with ropivacaine and its impact on hemodynamic parameters.\nThe study followed ethical standards and included 138 parturients. Group allocation was concealed, and the solutions were prepared to ensure blinding. The results indicated no significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate, and doses of vasopressor agents among the different groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the sensory and motor block characteristics, incidence of nausea/vomiting, shivering, and neonatal outcomes. The authors discussed potential reasons for the lack of significant differences, such as the slower onset of the spinal block after ropivacaine, the better hemodynamic profile of ropivacaine compared to bupivacaine, and the lower intrathecal volume of ropivacaine used in the study, all of which may have impacted the results. In conclusion, the study found that neither 4 mg nor 8 mg of ondansetron prevented hypotension in parturients undergoing spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine for cesarean section. The authors suggested the need for further studies to better understand the interaction between ropivacaine-induced neuraxial blockade and the preventive role of ondansetron for post-spinal hypotension, particularly with an emphasis on the pharmacokinetics of the administered drugs.\nAdvertisement\nKey Points\n- The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ondansetron in preventing maternal hypotension during spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine for cesarean sections. 138 primigravida parturients were randomly assigned to three groups: one received 4 mg of ondansetron, another received 8 mg of ondansetron, and the control group received normal saline.\n- The study concluded that there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of blood pressure, heart rate, doses of phenylephrine or ephedrine, time for the block, incidence of nausea/vomiting, umbilical artery pH, and neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, showing that ondansetron did not have a significant effect in preventing maternal hypotension following spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine for cesarean section.\n- Spinal anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean sections due to its fast onset and lower anesthetic risks, but it may cause hypotension and fetal compromise.
